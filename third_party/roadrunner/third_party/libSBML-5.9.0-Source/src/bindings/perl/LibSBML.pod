=head2 SBMLReader

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Methods for reading SBML from files and text strings.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
The SBMLReader class provides the main interface for reading SBML
content from files and strings.  The methods for reading SBML all return
an SBMLDocument object representing the results.
In the case of failures (such as if the SBML contains errors or a file
cannot be read), the errors will be recorded with the SBMLErrorLog
object kept in the SBMLDocument returned by SBMLReader.  Consequently,
immediately after calling a method on SBMLReader, callers should always
check for errors and warnings using the methods for this purpose
provided by SBMLDocument.
For convenience as well as easy access from other languages besides C++,
this file also defines two global functions,
libsbml::readSBML(@if java String filename@endif)
and libsbml::readSBMLFromString(@if java String xml@endif).
They are equivalent to creating an SBMLReader
object and then calling the
SBMLReader::readSBML(@if java String filename@endif) or
SBMLReader::readSBMLFromString(@if java String xml@endif)
methods, respectively.
@section compression Support for reading compressed files
LibSBML provides support for reading (as well as writing) compressed
SBML files.  The process is transparent to the calling
application&mdash;the application does not need to do anything
deliberate to invoke the functionality.  If a given SBML filename ends
with an extension for the I<gzip>, I<zip> or I<bzip2> compression
formats (respectively, @c .gz, @c .zip, or @c .bz2), then the methods
SBMLReader::readSBML(@if java String filename@endif) and
SBMLWriter::writeSBML(@if java SBMLDocument d, String filename@endif)
will automatically decompress and compress the file while writing and
reading it.  If the filename has no such extension, it
will be read and written uncompressed as normal.
The compression feature requires that the I<zlib> (for I<gzip> and @em
zip formats) and/or I<bzip2> (for I<bzip2> format) be available on the
system running libSBML, and that libSBML was configured with their
support compiled-in.  Please see the libSBML @if clike <a href="libsbml-installation.html">installation instructions</a> @endif@if python <a href="libsbml-installation.html">installation instructions</a> @endif@if java  <a href="../../../libsbml-installation.html">installation instructions</a> @endif@~ for more information about this.  The methods
@if java SBMLReader::hasZlib()@else hasZlib()@endif@~ and
@if java SBMLReader::hasBzip2()@else hasBzip2()@endif@~
can be used by an application to query at run-time whether support
for the compression libraries is available in the present copy of
libSBML.

Support for compression is not mandated by the SBML standard, but
applications may find it helpful, particularly when large SBML models
are being communicated across data links of limited bandwidth.

=item SBMLReader::SBMLReader

Creates a new SBMLReader and returns it. 
The libSBML SBMLReader objects offer methods for reading SBML in
XML form from files and text strings.


=item SBMLReader::readSBML

Reads an SBML document from a file.
This method is identical to SBMLReader::readSBMLFromFile(@if java String filename@endif).
If the file named C<filename> does not exist or its content is not
valid SBML, one or more errors will be logged with the SBMLDocument
object returned by this method.  Callers can use the methods on
SBMLDocument such as SBMLDocument::getNumErrors() and
SBMLDocument::getError(@if java long n@endif) to get the errors.  The object returned by
SBMLDocument::getError(@if java long n@endif) is an SBMLError object, and it has methods to
get the error code, category, and severity level of the problem, as
well as a textual description of the problem.  The possible severity
levels range from informational messages to fatal errors; see the
documentation for SBMLError for more information.
If the file C<filename> could not be read, the file-reading error will
appear first.  The error code @if clike (a value drawn from the enumeration
#XMLErrorCode_t) @endif@~ can provide a clue about what happened.  For example,
a file might be unreadable (either because it does not actually exist
or because the user does not have the necessary access priviledges to
read it) or some sort of file operation error may have been reported
by the underlying operating system.  Callers can check for these
situations using a program fragment such as the following:
@if clike
@verbatim
SBMLReader reader;
SBMLDocument  doc  = reader.readSBMLFromFile(filename);

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Methods for writing SBML to files and text strings.

=head2 SBase

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBase, the base class of most SBML
objects.

Most components in SBML are derived from a single abstract base type,
SBase.  In addition to serving as the parent class for most other
classes of objects in SBML, this base type is designed to allow a
modeler or a software package to attach arbitrary information to each
major element or list in an SBML model.
SBase has an optional subelement called "notes".  It is intended to
serve as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by
humans.  An example use of the "notes" element would be to contain
formatted user comments about the model element in which the "notes"
element is enclosed.  There are certain conditions on the XHTML content
permitted inside the "notes" element; please consult the <a
target="_blank" href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">SBML
specification document</a> corresponding to the SBML Level and Version
of your model for more information about the requirements for "notes"
content.

SBase has another optional subelement called "annotation".  Whereas the
"notes" element described above is a container for content to be shown
directly to humans, the "annotation" element is a container for optional
software-generated content I<not> meant to be shown to humans.  The
element's content type is <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#elemdecls">XML type
"any"</a>, allowing essentially arbitrary data content.  SBML places
only a few restrictions on the organization of the content; these are
intended to help software tools read and write the data as well as help
reduce conflicts between annotations added by different tools.  As is
the case with "notes", it is important to refer to the <a
target="_blank" href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">SBML
specification document</a> corresponding to the SBML Level and Version
of your model for more information about the requirements for
"annotation" content.
It is worth pointing out that the "annotation" element in the definition
of SBase exists in order that software developers may attach optional
application-specific data to the elements in an SBML model.  However, it
is important that this facility not be misused.  In particular, it is
<em>critical</em> that data essential to a model definition or that can
be encoded in existing SBML elements is <em>not</em> stored in
"annotation". Parameter values, functional dependencies between model
elements, etc., should not be recorded as annotations.  It is crucial to
keep in mind the fact that data placed in annotations can be freely
ignored by software applications.  If such data affects the
interpretation of a model, then software interoperability is greatly
impeded.

SBML Level 2 introduced an optional SBase attribute named "metaid" for
supporting metadata annotations using RDF (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Format</a>). The
attribute value has the data type <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>, the XML identifier
type, which means each "metaid" value must be globally unique within an
SBML file.  (Importantly, this uniqueness criterion applies across any
attribute with type <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML
ID</a>, not just the "metaid" attribute used by SBML&mdash;something to
be aware of if your application-specific XML content inside the
"annotation" subelement happens to use <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>.)  The "metaid" value
serves to identify a model component for purposes such as referencing
that component from metadata placed within "annotation" subelements.
Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, SBase also has an optional
attribute named "sboTerm" for supporting the use of the Systems Biology
Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the attribute is a string of
the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", where "NNNNNNN" is a seven digit integer number;
libSBML simplifies the representation by only storing the "NNNNNNN"
integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the "sboTerm" attribute on SBase has
data type C<int>, and SBO identifiers are stored simply as integers.
(For convenience, SBase offers methods for returning both the integer
form and a text-string form of the SBO identifier.)  SBO terms are a
type of optional annotation, and each different class of SBML object
derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about the values
permitted for "sboTerm".  Please consult the SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;4 specification for more information about the use of SBO
and the "sboTerm" attribute.
Finally, note that, in the list of methods on SBase, there is no public
constructor because SBase is an abstract class.  The constructors reside
in the subclasses derived from SBase.
@section sbase-miriam Standard format for annotations linking data resources
SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4, and Level&nbsp;3, define a proposed
regular format for encoding two particular categories of annotations:
(a) references to controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers
which define and describe biological and biochemical entities in a
model; and (b) descriptions of the provenance of a model, including its
author(s) and modification history.

=item SBase::isSetNotes

Predicate returning C<true> if this
object's "notes" subelement exists and has content.
The optional SBML element named "notes", present on every major SBML
component type, is intended as a place for storing optional
information intended to be seen by humans.  An example use of the
"notes" element would be to contain formatted user comments about the
model element in which the "notes" element is enclosed.  Every object
derived directly or indirectly from type SBase can have a separate
value for "notes", allowing users considerable freedom when adding
comments to their models.
The format of "notes" elements must be <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a>.  To help
verify the formatting of "notes" content, libSBML provides the static
utility method SyntaxChecker::hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax(@if java XMLNode xhtml@endif); however,
readers are urged to consult the appropriate <a target="_blank"
href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">SBML specification

=item SBase::isSetAnnotation

Predicate returning C<true> if this

optional software-generated content I<not> meant to be shown to

=item SBase::setSBOTerm

Sets the value of the "sboTerm" attribute.
Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, objects derived from SBase have
an optional attribute named "sboTerm" for supporting the use of the
Systems Biology Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the
attribute is a string of the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", where "NNNNNNN" is a
seven digit integer number; libSBML simplifies the representation by
only storing the "NNNNNNN" integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the
"sboTerm" attribute on SBase has data type C<int>, and SBO identifiers
are stored simply as integers. 
SBO terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class
of SBML object derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about
the values permitted for "sboTerm".  Please consult the SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 specification for more information about
the use of SBO and the "sboTerm" attribute.

Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, objects derived from SBase have
an optional attribute named "sboTerm" for supporting the use of the
Systems Biology Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the
attribute is a string of the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", where "NNNNNNN" is a
seven digit integer number; libSBML simplifies the representation by
only storing the "NNNNNNN" integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the
"sboTerm" attribute on SBase has data type C<int>, and SBO identifiers
are stored simply as integers.  This method lets you set the value of
"sboTerm" as a complete string of the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", whereas
setSBOTerm(int value) allows you to set it using the integer form.
SBO terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class
of SBML object derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about
the values permitted for "sboTerm".  Please consult the SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 specification for more information about
the use of SBO and the "sboTerm" attribute.
@param sboid the SBO identifier string of the form "SBO:NNNNNNN"

=item SBase::setNamespaces

Sets the namespaces relevant of this SBML object.
The content of C<xmlns> is copied, and this object's existing
namespace content is deleted.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.

@return integer value indicating success/failure of the
function.  The possible values returned by this function are:

=item SBase::unsetId

Unsets the value of the "id" attribute of this SBML object.
Most (but not all) objects in SBML include two common attributes: "id"
and "name".  The identifier given by an object's "id" attribute value
is used to identify the object within the SBML model definition.
Other objects can refer to the component using this identifier.

@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_OPERATION_FAILED LIBSBML_OPERATION_FAILED @endlink


=item SBase::unsetName

Unsets the value of the "name" attribute of this SBML object.
Most (but not all) objects in SBML include two common attributes: "id"
and "name".  In contrast to the "id" attribute, the "name" attribute is
optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
label for the component.  The data type of "name" is the type
C<string> defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no
restrictions as to the content of "name" attributes beyond those
restrictions defined by the C<string> type in XML Schema.
The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows.  If a
software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name"
attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
component's label instead of the component's "id".  If the user
interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name"
attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
should display the value of the "id" attribute instead.  (Script
language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of
"name".)

As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems
may display the "id"'s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a)
reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated
form of the name attribute value.
An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
restrictions on the uniqueness of "id" values, there are no
restrictions on the uniqueness of "name" values in a model.  This
allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.
@return integer value indicating success/failure of the
function.  The possible values returned by this function are:

@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_OPERATION_FAILED LIBSBML_OPERATION_FAILED @endlink


=item SBase::unsetNotes

Unsets the value of the "notes" subelement of this SBML object.
The optional SBML element named "notes", present on every major SBML
component type, is intended as a place for storing optional
information intended to be seen by humans.  An example use of the
"notes" element would be to contain formatted user comments about the
model element in which the "notes" element is enclosed.  Every object
derived directly or indirectly from type SBase can have a separate
value for "notes", allowing users considerable freedom when adding
comments to their models.
The format of "notes" elements must be <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a>.  To help
verify the formatting of "notes" content, libSBML provides the static
utility method SyntaxChecker::hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax(@if java XMLNode xhtml@endif); however,
readers are urged to consult the appropriate <a target="_blank"
href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">SBML specification
document</a> for the Level and Version of their model for more
in-depth explanations.  The SBML Level&nbsp;2 and &nbsp;3
specifications have considerable detail about how "notes" element
content must be structured.

=item SBase::unsetAnnotation

Unsets the value of the "annotation" subelement of this SBML object.
Whereas the SBase "notes" subelement is a container for content to be
shown directly to humans, the "annotation" element is a container for
optional software-generated content I<not> meant to be shown to
humans.  Every object derived from SBase can have its own value for
"annotation".  The element's content type is <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#elemdecls">XML type
"any"</a>, allowing essentially arbitrary well-formed XML data
content.

SBML places a few restrictions on the organization of the content of
annotations; these are intended to help software tools read and write
the data as well as help reduce conflicts between annotations added by
different tools.  Please see the SBML specifications for more details.

=item SBase::getResourceBiologicalQualifier

Returns the MIRIAM <em>biological qualifier</em> associated with the
given resource.
In <a target="_blank" href="http://biomodels.net/miriam">MIRIAM</a>,
qualifiers are an optional means of indicating the relationship
between a model component and its annotations.  There are two broad
kinds of annotations: <em>model</em> and <em>biological</em>.  The
latter kind is used to qualify the relationship between a model
component and a biological entity which it represents.  Examples of
relationships include "is" and "has part", but many others are
possible.  MIRIAM defines <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/qualifiers/">numerous
relationship qualifiers</a> to enable different software tools to
qualify biological annotations in the same standardized way.  In
libSBML, the MIRIAM controlled-vocabulary annotations on an SBML model

=item SBase::disablePackage

Disables the given SBML Level&nbsp;3 package on this object.
This method disables the specified package on this object
and other objects connected by child-parent links in the same
SBMLDocument object.
An example of when this may be useful is during construction of model
components when mixing existing and new models.  Suppose your
application read an SBML document containing a model that used the SBML
Hierarchical Model Composition (&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) package, and
extracted parts of that model in order to construct a new model in
memory.  The new, in-memory model will not accept a component drawn from
an other SBMLDocument with different package namespace declarations.
You could reconstruct the same namespaces in the in-memory model first,
but as a shortcut, you could also disable the package namespace on the
object being added.  Here is a code example to help clarify this:
@if clike @verbatim
// We read in an SBML L3V1 model that uses the 'comp' package namespace
doc = readSBML("sbml-file-with-comp-elements.xml");
// We extract one of the species from the model we just read in.
Species  s1 = doc->getModel()->getSpecies(0);
// We construct a new model.  This model does not use the 'comp' package.
Model   newModel = new Model(3,1);
// The following will fail with an error, because addSpecies() will
// first check that the parent of the given object has namespaces
// declared, and will discover that s1 does but newModel does not.
// newModel->addSpecies(s1);
// However, if we disable the 'comp' package on s1, then the call
// to addSpecies will work.
s1->disablePackage("http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/comp/version1",
"comp");
newModel->addSpecies(s1);

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Model construct.
In an SBML model definition, a single object of class Model serves as
the overall container for the lists of the various model components.
All of the lists are optional, but if a given list container is present
within the model, the list must not be empty; that is, it must have
length one or more.  The following are the components and lists
permitted in different Levels and Versions of SBML in
version @htmlinclude libsbml-version.html
of libSBML:
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\nIn SBML Level 1, the components are: UnitDefinition, Compartment,
Species, Parameter, Rule, and Reaction.  Instances of the classes are
placed inside instances of classes ListOfUnitDefinitions,
ListOfCompartments, ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfRules, and
ListOfReactions.

\n=item\n\nIn SBML Level 2 Version 1, the components are: FunctionDefinition,
UnitDefinition, Compartment, Species, Parameter, Rule, Reaction and
Event.  Instances of the classes are placed inside instances of classes
ListOfFunctionDefinitions, ListOfUnitDefinitions, ListOfCompartments,
ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfRules, ListOfReactions, and
ListOfEvents.

\n=item\n\nIn SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4, the components are:
FunctionDefinition, UnitDefinition, CompartmentType, SpeciesType,
Compartment, Species, Parameter, InitialAssignment, Rule, Constraint,
Reaction and Event.  Instances of the classes are placed inside
instances of classes ListOfFunctionDefinitions, ListOfUnitDefinitions,
ListOfCompartmentTypes, ListOfSpeciesTypes, ListOfCompartments,
ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfInitialAssignments, ListOfRules,
ListOfConstraints, ListOfReactions, and ListOfEvents.
\n=item\n\nIn SBML Level 3 Version 1, the components are: FunctionDefinition,
UnitDefinition, Compartment, Species, Parameter, InitialAssignment,
Rule, Constraint, Reaction and Event.  Instances of the classes are
placed inside instances of classes ListOfFunctionDefinitions,
ListOfUnitDefinitions, ListOfCompartments, ListOfSpecies,
ListOfParameters, ListOfInitialAssignments, ListOfRules,
ListOfConstraints, ListOfReactions, and ListOfEvents.  
\n=back\n

Although all the lists are optional, there are dependencies between SBML
components such that defining some components requires defining others.
An example is that defining a species requires defining a compartment,
and defining a reaction requires defining a species.  The dependencies
are explained in more detail in the SBML specifications.
In addition to the above lists and attributes, the Model class in both
SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 has the usual two attributes of "id"
and "name", and both are optional.  As is the case for other SBML
components with "id" and "name" attributes, they must be used according
to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.  (Within the
frameworks of SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core, a
Model object identifier has no assigned meaning, but extension packages
planned for SBML Level&nbsp;3 are likely to make use of this
identifier.)

Finally, SBML Level&nbsp;3 has introduced a number of additional Model
attributes.  They are discussed in a separate section below.
@section approaches Approaches to creating objects using the libSBML API
LibSBML provides two main mechanisms for creating objects: class
constructors
(e.g., @if java <a href="org/sbml/libsbml/Species.html">Species()</a> @else Species::Species() @endif), 
and <code>create<span class="placeholder"><em>Object</em></span>()</code>
methods (such as Model::createSpecies()) provided by certain <span
class="placeholder"><em>Object</em></span> classes such as Model.  These
multiple mechanisms are provided by libSBML for flexibility and to
support different use-cases, but they also have different implications
for the overall model structure.
In general, the recommended approach is to use the <code>create<span
class="placeholder"><em>Object</em></span>()</code> methods.  These
methods both create an object I<and> link it to the parent in one step.
Here is an example:@if clike
@verbatim
// Create an SBMLDocument object in Level 3 Version 1 format:
SBMLDocument  sbmlDoc = new SBMLDocument(3, 1);
// Create a Model object inside the SBMLDocument object and set
// its identifier.  The call returns a pointer to the Model object
// created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
// of the object attached to the model (as expected).
Model  model = sbmlDoc->createModel();
model->setId("BestModelEver");
// Create a Species object inside the Model and set its identifier.
// Similar to the lines above, this call returns a pointer to the Species
// object created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
// of the object attached to the model (as expected).
Species  sp = model->createSpecies();
sp->setId("MySpecies");
@endverbatim
@endif@if java
@verbatim
// Create an SBMLDocument object in Level 3 Version 1 format:
SBMLDocument sbmlDoc = new SBMLDocument(3, 1);
// Create a Model object inside the SBMLDocument object and set
// its identifier.  The call returns a pointer to the Model object
// created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
// of the object attached to the model (as expected).  Note that
// the call to setId() returns a status code, and a real program
// should check this status code to make sure everything went okay.
Model model = sbmlDoc.createModel();
model.setId(&#34;BestModelEver&#34;);
// Create a Species object inside the Model and set its identifier.
// Similar to the lines above, this call returns a pointer to the Species
// object created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
// of the object attached to the model (as expected).  Note that, like
// with Model, the call to setId() returns a status code, and a real program
// should check this status code to make sure everything went okay.
Species sp = model.createSpecies();
sp.setId(&#34;BestSpeciesEver&#34;);
@endverbatim
@endif@if python
@verbatim
# Create an SBMLDocument object in Level 3 Version 1 format:
sbmlDoc = SBMLDocument(3, 1)
# Create a Model object inside the SBMLDocument object and set
# its identifier.  The call to setId() returns a status code
# to indicate whether the assignment was successful.  Code 0
# means success; see the documentation for Model's setId() for 
# more information.
model = sbmlDoc.createModel()
model.setId(&#34;BestModelEver&#34;)
# Create a Species object inside the Model and set its identifier.
# Again, the setId() returns a status code to indicate whether the
# assignment was successful.  Code 0 means success; see the
# documentation for Specie's setId() for more information.
sp = model.createSpecies()
sp.setId(&#34;BestSpeciesEver&#34;)
@endverbatim
@endif@if csharp
@verbatim
// Create an SBMLDocument object in Level 3 Version 1 format:
SBMLDocument sbmlDoc = new SBMLDocument(3, 1);
// Create a Model object inside the SBMLDocument object and set
// its identifier.  The call returns a pointer to the Model object
// created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
// of the object attached to the model (as expected).
Model model = sbmlDoc.createModel();
model.setId("BestModelEver");
// Create a Species object inside the Model and set its identifier.
// Similar to the lines above, this call returns a pointer to the Species
// object created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
// of the object attached to the model (as expected).
Species sp = model.createSpecies();
sp.setId("MySpecies");
@endverbatim
@endif@~

The <code>create<span
class="placeholder"><em>Object</em></span>()</code> methods return a
pointer to the object created, but they also add the object to the
relevant list of object instances contained in the parent.  (These lists
become the <code>&lt;listOf<span
class="placeholder"><em>Object</em></span>s&gt;</code> elements in the
finished XML rendition of SBML.)  In the example above,
Model::createSpecies() adds the created species directly to the
C<&lt;listOfSpecies&gt;> list in the model.  Subsequently,
methods called on the species change the species in the model (which is
what is expected in most situations).
@section checking Consistency and adherence to SBML specifications
To make it easier for applications to do whatever they need,
libSBML version @htmlinclude libsbml-version.html
is relatively lax when it comes to enforcing correctness and
completeness of models I<during> model construction and editing.
Essentially, libSBML I<will> I<not> in most cases check automatically
that a model's components have valid attribute values, or that the
overall model is consistent and free of errors&mdash;even obvious errors
such as duplication of identifiers.  This allows applications great
leeway in how they build their models, but it means that software
authors must take deliberate steps to ensure that the model will be, in
the end, valid SBML.  These steps include such things as keeping track
of the identifiers used in a model, manually performing updates in
certain situations where an entity is referenced in more than one place
(e.g., a species that is referenced by multiple SpeciesReference
objects), and so on.
That said, libSBML does provide powerful features for deliberately
performing validation of SBML when an application decides it is time to
do so.  The interfaces to these facilities are on the SBMLDocument
class, in the form of SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() and
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency().  Please refer to the documentation for
SBMLDocument for more information about this.
While applications may play fast and loose and live like free spirits
during the construction and editing of SBML models, they should always
make sure to call SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() and/or
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() before writing out the final version of
an SBML model.
@section model-l3-attrib Model attributes introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3
As mentioned above, the Model class has a number of optional attributes
in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core.  These are "substanceUnits",
"timeUnits", "volumeUnits", "areaUnits", "lengthUnits", "extentUnits",
and "conversionFactor.  The following provide more information about
them.

@subsection model-l3-substanceunits The "substanceUnits" attribute
The "substanceUnits" attribute is used to specify the unit of
measurement associated with substance quantities of Species objects that
do not specify units explicitly.  If a given Species object definition
does not specify its unit of substance quantity via the "substanceUnits"
attribute on the Species object instance, then that species inherits the
value of the Model "substanceUnits" attribute.  If the Model does not
define a value for this attribute, then there is no unit to inherit, and
all species that do not specify individual "substanceUnits" attribute
values then have <em>no</em> declared units for their quantities.  The
SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specification provides more
details.

Note that when the identifier of a species appears in a model's
mathematical expressions, the unit of measurement associated with that
identifier is <em>not solely determined</em> by setting "substanceUnits"
on Model or Species.  Please see the discussion about units given in
the documentation for the Species class.
@subsection model-l3-timeunits The "timeUnits" attribute
The "timeUnits" attribute on SBML Level&nbsp;3's Model object is used to
specify the unit in which time is measured in the model.  This attribute
on Model is the <em>only</em> way to specify a unit for time in a model.
It is a global attribute; time is measured in the model everywhere in
the same way.  This is particularly relevant to Reaction and RateRule
objects in a model: all Reaction and RateRule objects in SBML define
per-time values, and the unit of time is given by the "timeUnits"
attribute on the Model object instance.  If the Model "timeUnits"
attribute has no value, it means that the unit of time is not defined
for the model's reactions and rate rules.  Leaving it unspecified in an
SBML model does not result in an invalid model in SBML Level&nbsp;3;
however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that all
models specify units of measurement for time.
@subsection model-l3-voletc The "volumeUnits", "areaUnits", and "lengthUnits" attributes
The attributes "volumeUnits", "areaUnits" and "lengthUnits" together are
used to set the units of measurements for the sizes of Compartment
objects in an SBML Level&nbsp;3 model when those objects do not
otherwise specify units.  The three attributes correspond to the most
common cases of compartment dimensions: "volumeUnits" for compartments
having a "spatialDimensions" attribute value of C<"3">, "areaUnits" for
compartments having a "spatialDimensions" attribute value of C<"2">, and
"lengthUnits" for compartments having a "spatialDimensions" attribute
value of C<"1">.  The attributes are not applicable to compartments
whose "spatialDimensions" attribute values are I<not> one of C<"1">, @c
"2" or C<"3">.
If a given Compartment object instance does not provide a value for its
"units" attribute, then the unit of measurement of that compartment's
size is inherited from the value specified by the Model "volumeUnits",
"areaUnits" or "lengthUnits" attribute, as appropriate based on the
Compartment object's "spatialDimensions" attribute value.  If the Model
object does not define the relevant attribute, then there are no units
to inherit, and all Compartment objects that do not set a value for
their "units" attribute then have <em>no</em> units associated with
their compartment sizes.
The use of three separate attributes is a carry-over from SBML
Level&nbsp;2.  Note that it is entirely possible for a model to define a
value for two or more of the attributes "volumeUnits", "areaUnits" and
"lengthUnits" simultaneously, because SBML models may contain
compartments with different numbers of dimensions.
@subsection model-l3-extentunits The "extentUnits" attribute
Reactions are processes that occur over time.  These processes involve
events of some sort, where a single ``reaction event'' is one in which
some set of entities (known as reactants, products and modifiers in
SBML) interact, once.  The <em>extent</em> of a reaction is a measure of
how many times the reaction has occurred, while the time derivative of
the extent gives the instantaneous rate at which the reaction is
occurring.  Thus, what is colloquially referred to as the "rate of the
reaction" is in fact equal to the rate of change of reaction extent.
In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the combination of "extentUnits" and "timeUnits"
defines the units of kinetic laws in SBML and establishes how the
numerical value of each KineticLaw object's mathematical formula is
meant to be interpreted in a model.  The units of the kinetic laws are
taken to be "extentUnits" divided by "timeUnits".
Note that this embodies an important principle in SBML Level&nbsp;3
models: <em>all reactions in an SBML model must have the same units</em>
for the rate of change of extent.  In other words, the units of all
reaction rates in the model <em>must be the same</em>.  There is only
one global value for "extentUnits" and one global value for "timeUnits".
@subsection model-l3-convfactor The "conversionFactor" attribute
The attribute "conversionFactor" in SBML Level&nbsp;3's Model object
defines a global value inherited by all Species object instances that do
not define separate values for their "conversionFactor" attributes.  The
value of this attribute must refer to a Parameter object instance
defined in the model.  The Parameter object in question must be a
constant; ie it must have its "constant" attribute value set to @c
"true".

If a given Species object definition does not specify a conversion
factor via the "conversionFactor" attribute on Species, then the species
inherits the conversion factor specified by the Model "conversionFactor"
attribute.  If the Model does not define a value for this attribute,
then there is no conversion factor to inherit.  More information about
conversion factors is provided in the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1
specification.

copy of C<annotation>.
Any existing content of the "annotation" subelement is discarded.
Unless you have taken steps to first copy and reconstitute any
existing annotations into the C<annotation> that is about to be
assigned, it is likely that performing such wholesale replacement is
unfriendly towards other software applications whose annotations are
discarded.  An alternative may be to use appendAnnotation().

=item Model::populateListFormulaUnitsData

Populates the list of FormulaDataUnits with the units derived 
for the model. The list contains elements of class
FormulaUnitsData. 

The first element of the list refers to the default units
of 'substance per time' derived from the model and has the
unitReferenceId 'subs_per_time'. This facilitates the comparison of units
derived from mathematical formula with the expected units.
The next elements of the list record the units of the 
compartments and species established from either explicitly
declared or default units.
The next elements record the units of any parameters.
Subsequent elements of the list record the units derived for
each mathematical expression encountered within the model.
@note This function is utilised by the Unit Consistency Validator.
The list is populated prior to running the validation and thus
the consistency of units can be checked by accessing the members
of the list and comparing the appropriate data.

@endif@~
When creating fresh models programmatically, the starting point is
typically the creation of an SBMLDocument object instance.  The
SBMLDocument constructor accepts arguments for the SBML Level and
Version of the model to be created.  After creating the SBMLDocument
object, calling programs then typically call SBMLDocument::createModel()
almost immediately, and then proceed to call the methods on the Model
object to fill out the model's contents.
SBMLDocument corresponds roughly to the class <i>Sbml</i> defined in the
SBML Level&nbsp;2 specification and <i>SBML</i> in the Level&nbsp;3
specification.  It does not have a direct correspondence in SBML
Level&nbsp;1.  (However, to make matters simpler for applications,
libSBML creates an SBMLDocument no matter whether the model is
Level&nbsp;1, Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;3.)  In its barest form, when written out in
XML format for (e.g.) SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4, the corresponding
structure is the following:
@verbatim
<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version4" level="2" version="4">
...
</sbml>@endverbatim
SBMLDocument is derived from SBase, and therefore contains the usual SBase
attributes (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3) of "metaid" and "sboTerm", as
well as the subelements "notes" and "annotation".  It also contains the
attributes "level" and "version" indicating the Level and Version of the
SBML data structure.  These can be accessed using the methods defined by
the SBase class for that purpose.
@section checking Checking consistency and adherence to SBML specifications
One of the most important features of libSBML is its ability to perform
SBML validation to ensure that a model adheres to the SBML specification
for whatever Level+Version combination the model uses.  SBMLDocument
provides the methods for running consistency-checking and validation
rules on the SBML content.
First, a brief explanation of the rationale is in order.  In libSBML
versions up to and including the version&nbsp;3.3.x series, the
individual methods for creating and setting attributes and other
components were quite lenient, and allowed a caller to compose SBML
entities that might not, in the end, represent valid SBML.  This allowed
applications the freedom to do things such as save incomplete models
(which is useful when models are being developed over long periods of
time).  In the version&nbsp;4.x series, libSBML is somewhat stricter,
but still permits structures to be created independently and the results
to be combined in a separate step.  In all these cases, it means that a
separate validation step is necessary when a calling program finally
wants to finish a complete SBML document.
The primary interface to this validation facility is SBMLDocument's
SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() and
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency().  The former verifies the basic
internal consistency and syntax of an SBML document, and the latter
implements more elaborate validation rules (both those defined by the
SBML specifications, as well as additional rules offered by libSBML).
@if clike The checks performed by SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() are
hardwired and cannot be changed by calling programs, but the validation
performed by SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() is under program control
using the method SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks().  Applications can
selectively disable specific kinds of checks that they may not be
interested in, by calling SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks() with
appropriate parameters.
@endif@if python The checks performed by SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() are
hardwired and cannot be changed by calling programs, but the validation
performed by SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() is under program control
using the method SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks().  Applications can
selectively disable specific kinds of checks that they may not be
interested in, by calling SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks() with
appropriate parameters.
@endif@if java The checks performed by SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() are
hardwired and cannot be changed by calling programs, but the validation
performed by SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() is under program control
using the method SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks(int categ, boolean
onoff).  Applications can selectively disable specific kinds of checks
that they may not be interested by calling
SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks(int categ, boolean onoff) with
appropriate parameters.
@endif@~

These methods have slightly different relevance depending on whether a
model is created programmaticaly from scratch, or whether it is read in
from a file or data stream.  The following list summarizes the possible
scenarios.

<em>Scenario 1: Creating a model from scratch</em>.  Before writing out
the model, 
@li Call SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency(), then inquire about
the results by calling SBMLDocument::getNumErrors()
@li Call @if java SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks(int categ, boolean
onoff) @else SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks() @endif@~ to configure
which checks will be performed by SBMLDocument::checkConsistency()
@li Call SBMLDocument::checkConsistency(), then inquire about the results by
calling SBMLDocument::getNumErrors()
<em>Scenario 2: Reading a model from a file or data stream.</em> After
reading the model,
@li Basic consistency checks will have been performed automatically by
libSBML upon reading the content, so you only need to inquire about the
results by using SBMLDocument::getNumErrors()
@li Call @if java SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks(int categ, boolean
onoff) @else SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks() @endif@~ to configure
which checks are performed by SBMLDocument::checkConsistency()
@li Call SBMLDocument::checkConsistency(), then inquire about the results
by calling SBMLDocument::getNumErrors()
@if clike An example of using the consistency-checking
and validation facilities is provided in this manual in the
section @ref libsbml-example. @endif@~
@section converting Converting documents between Levels and Versions of SBML
LibSBML provides facilities for limited translation of SBML between
Levels and Versions of the SBML specifications.  The method for doing is
is @if java SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion(long lev, long ver, boolean strict) @else setLevelAndVersion() @endif.  In 
general, models can be converted upward without difficulty (e.g., from
SBML Level&nbsp;1 to Level&nbsp;2, or from an earlier Version of
Level&nbsp;2 to the latest Version of Level&nbsp;2).  Sometimes models
can be translated downward as well, if they do not use constructs
specific to more advanced Levels of SBML.
Calling @if java SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion(long lev, long ver, boolean strict) @else SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion() @endif@~ will not I<necessarily> lead
to a successful conversion.  The method will return a boolean value
to indicate success or failure.  Callers must check the error log (see 
next section) attached to the SBMLDocument object after calling
@if java SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion(long lev, long ver) @else SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion() @endif@~ in order to assess whether any
problems arose.
If an application is interested in translating to a lower Level and/or
Version of SBML within a Level, the following methods allow for prior
assessment of whether there is sufficient compatibility to make a
translation possible:
@li SBMLDocument::checkL1Compatibility(),
@li SBMLDocument::checkL2v1Compatibility(),
@li SBMLDocument::checkL2v2Compatibility(),
@li SBMLDocument::checkL2v3Compatibility(), 
@li SBMLDocument::checkL2v4Compatibility(), and
@li SBMLDocument::checkL3v1Compatibility().
Some changes between Versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2 may lead to
unexpected behaviors when attempting conversions in either direction.
For example, SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 relaxed the requirement
for consistency in units of measurement between expressions annd
quantities in a model.  As a result, a model written in Version&nbsp;4,
if converted to Version&nbsp;3 with no other changes, may fail
validation as a Version&nbsp;3 model because Version&nbsp;3 imposed
stricter requirements on unit consistency.
Other changes between SBML Level 2 and Level 3 make downward conversions
challenging.  In some cases, it means that a model converted to
Level&nbsp;2 from Level&nbsp;3 will contain attributes that were not
explicitly given in the Level&nbsp;3 model, because in Level&nbsp;2
these attributes may have been optional or have default values.
@section errors Error handling
Upon reading a model, SBMLDocument logs any problems encountered while
reading the model from the file or data stream.  The log contains
objects that record diagnostic information about any notable issues that
arose.  Whether the problems are warnings or errors, they are both
reported through a single common interface involving the object class
SBMLError.

The methods SBMLDocument::getNumErrors(), @if java SBMLDocument::getError(long n) @else SBMLDocument::getError() @endif@~ and
SBMLDocument::printErrors() allow callers to interact with the warnings
or errors logged.  Alternatively, callers may retrieve the entire log as
an SBMLErrorLog object using the method SBMLDocument::getErrorLog().
The SBMLErrorLog object provides some alternative methods for
interacting with the set of errors and warnings.  In either case,
applications typically should first call SBMLDocument::getNumErrors() to
find out if any issues have been logged after specific libSBML
operations such as the ones discussed in the sections above.  If they
have, then an application will should proceed to inspect the individual
reports using either the direct interfaces on SBMLDocument or using the
methods on the SBMLErrorLog object.
@if clike An example of using the error facility is
provided in this manual in the
section @ref libsbml-example. @endif@~

@return a List of pointers to all children objects.


=item SBMLDocument::expandFunctionDefinitions

Removes FunctionDefinition constructs from the document and expands
any instances of their use within C<&lt;math&gt;> elements.
For example, suppose a Model contains a FunctionDefinition with
identifier C<"f"> representing the math expression: <em>f(x, y) = x  
y</em>.  Suppose further that there is a reaction in which the
C<&lt;math&gt;> element of the KineticLaw object contains
C<f(s, p)>, where C<s> and C<p> are other identifiers
defined in the model.  The outcome of invoking this method is that the
C<&lt;math&gt;> of the KineticLaw now represents the
expression <em>s   p</em> and the model no longer contains any
FunctionDefinition objects.
@return bool C<true> if the transformation was successful, 
C<false>, otherwise.
@note This function will check the consistency of a model before
attemptimg the transformation.  If the model is not valid SBML, the
transformation will not be performed and the function will return @c
false.


=item SBMLDocument::expandInitialAssignments

Removes InitialAssignment constructs from the document and
replaces them with appropriate values.
For example, suppose a Model contains a InitialAssignment to a symbol
C<"k"> where C<"k"> is the identifier of a Parameter.  The outcome of
invoking this method is that the "value" attribute of the Parameter
definition is set to the result calculated using the InitialAssignment
object's C<&lt;math&gt;> formula, and the corresponding
InitialAssignment is then removed from the Model.
@return bool C<true> if the transformation was successful, 
C<false>, otherwise.
@note This function will check the consistency of a model before
attemptimg the transformation.  If the model is not valid SBML, the
transformation will not be performed and the function will return @c
false.  As part of that process, this method will check that it has
values for any components referred to by the C<&lt;math&gt;>
elements of InitialAssignment objects.  In cases where not all of the
values have been declared (e.g., if the mathematical expression refers
to model entities that have no declared values), the InitialAssignment
in question will I<not> be removed and this method will return @c
false.


=item SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion

Sets the SBML Level and Version of this SBMLDocument instance,
attempting to convert the model as needed.
This method is the principal way in libSBML to convert models between
Levels and Versions of SBML.  Generally, models can be converted
upward without difficulty (e.g., from SBML Level&nbsp;1 to
Level&nbsp;2, or from an earlier Version of Level&nbsp;2 to the latest
Version of Level&nbsp;2).  Sometimes models can be translated downward
as well, if they do not use constructs specific to more advanced
Levels of SBML.
Before calling this method, callers may check compatibility directly
using the methods SBMLDocument::checkL1Compatibility(),
SBMLDocument::checkL2v1Compatibility(),
SBMLDocument::checkL2v2Compatibility(),
SBMLDocument::checkL2v3Compatibility(),
SBMLDocument::checkL2v4Compatibility(), and
SBMLDocument::checkL3v1Compatibility().

The valid combinations of SBML Level and Version as of this release
of libSBML are the following:

Strict conversion applies the additional criteria that both the
source and the target model must be consistent SBML.  Users can
control the consistency checks that are applied using the
SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecksForConversion(@if java int categ, boolean onoff@endif) method.  If either
the source or the potential target model have validation errors, the
conversion is not performed.  When a strict conversion is successful,
the underlying SBML object model is altered to reflect the new level
and version.  Thus, information that cannot be converted
(e.g. sboTerms) will be lost.
@param level the desired SBML Level
@param version the desired Version within the SBML Level
@param strict boolean indicating whether to check consistency
of both the source and target model when performing
conversion (defaults to C< true >)
@return C<true> if the level and version of the document were
successfully set to the requested values (which may have required
conversion of the model), C<false> otherwise.
@note Calling this method will not I<necessarily> lead to a successful
conversion.  If the conversion fails, it will be logged in the error
list associated with this SBMLDocument.  Callers should consult
getNumErrors() to find out if the conversion succeeded without
problems.  For conversions from Level&nbsp;2 to Level&nbsp;1, callers
can also check the Level of the model after calling this method to
find out whether it is Level&nbsp;1.  (If the conversion to
Level&nbsp;1 failed, the Level of this model will be left unchanged.)

=head2 FunctionDefinition

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's FunctionDefinition construct.
The FunctionDefinition structure associates an identifier with a
function definition.  This identifier can then be used as the function
called in subsequent MathML content elsewhere in an SBML model.
FunctionDefinition has one required attribute, "id", to give the
function a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
definition can refer to it.  A FunctionDefinition instance can also have
an optional "name" attribute of type C<string>.  Identifiers and names
must be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML
specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
specification).

FunctionDefinition has a required "math" subelement containing a MathML
expression defining the function body.  The content of this element can
only be a MathML "lambda" element.  The "lambda" element must begin with
zero or more "bvar" elements, followed by any other of the elements in
the MathML subset allowed in SBML Level 2 I<except> "lambda" (i.e., a
"lambda" element cannot contain another "lambda" element).  This is the
only place in SBML where a "lambda" element can be used.  The function
defined by a FunctionDefinition is only available for use in other
MathML elements that I<follow> the FunctionDefinition definition in the
model.  (These restrictions prevent recursive and mutually-recursive
functions from being expressed.)
A further restriction on the content of "math" is that it cannot contain
references to variables other than the variables declared to the
"lambda" itself.  That is, the contents of MathML "ci" elements inside
the body of the "lambda" can only be the variables declared by its
"bvar" elements, or the identifiers of other FunctionDefinition
instances in the model.  This means must be written so that all
variables or parameters used in the MathML content are passed to them
via their function parameters.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, this restriction
applies also to the MathML C<csymbol> elements for I<time> and @em
delay; in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it additionally applies to the C<csymbol>
element for I<avogadro>.
@note Function definitions (also informally known as user-defined
functions) were introduced in SBML Level 2.  They have purposefully
limited capabilities.  A function cannot reference parameters or other
model quantities outside of itself; values must be passed as parameters
to the function.  Moreover, recursive and mutually-recursive functions
are not permitted.  The purpose of these limitations is to balance power
against complexity of implementation.  With the restrictions as they
are, function definitions could be implemented as textual
substitutions&mdash;they are simply macros.  Software implementations
therefore do not need the full function-definition machinery typically
associated with programming languages.
<br><br>
Another important point to note is FunctionDefinition does not
have a separate attribute for defining the units of the value returned
by the function.  The units associated with the function's return value,
when the function is called from within MathML expressions elsewhere in
SBML, are simply the overall units of the expression in
FunctionDefinition's "math" subelement when applied to the arguments
supplied in the call to the function.  Ascertaining these units requires
performing dimensional analysis on the expression.  (Readers may wonder
why there is no attribute.  The reason is that having a separate
attribute for declaring the units would not only be redundant, but also
lead to the potential for having conflicting information.  In the case
of a conflict between the declared units and those of the value actually
returned by the function, the only logical resolution rule would be to
assume that the correct units are those of the expression anyway.)

=head2 Unit

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Unit construct.
The SBML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects,
UnitDefinition and Unit.  The approach to defining units in SBML is
compositional; for example, <em>meter second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em> is
constructed by combining a Unit object representing <em>meter</em> with
another Unit object representing <em>second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em>.
The combination is wrapped inside a UnitDefinition, which provides for
assigning an identifier and optional name to the combination.  The
identifier can then be referenced from elsewhere in a model.  Thus, the
UnitDefinition class is the container, and Unit instances are placed
inside UnitDefinition instances.
A Unit structure has four attributes named "kind", "exponent", "scale"
and "multiplier".  It represents a (possibly transformed) reference to a
base unit.  The attribute "kind" on Unit indicates the chosen base unit.
Its value must be one of the text strings listed below; this list
corresponds to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core:
C<opydetails> doc_base_units
A few small differences exist between the Level&nbsp;3 list of base
units and the list defined in other Level/Version combinations of SBML.
Specifically, Levels of SBML before Level&nbsp;3 do not define @c
avogadro; conversely, Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 defines C<Celsius>,
and Level&nbsp;1 defines C<celsius>, C<meter>, and C<liter>, none of
which are available in Level&nbsp;3.  In libSBML, each of the predefined
base unit names is represented by an enumeration value @if clike in
#UnitKind_t@else whose name begins with the characters
C<UNIT_KIND_>@endif, discussed in a separate section below.
The attribute named "exponent" on Unit represents an exponent on the
unit.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute is optional and has a default
value of C<1> (one); in SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is mandatory
and there is no default value.  A Unit structure also has an attribute
called "scale"; its value must be an integer exponent for a power-of-ten
multiplier used to set the scale of the unit.  For example, a unit
having a "kind" value of C<gram> and a "scale" value of C<-3> signifies
10<sup>&nbsp;&ndash;3</sup> \f$\times\f$ gram, or milligrams.  In SBML
Level&nbsp;2, the attribute is optional and has a default value of C<0>
(zero), because 10<sup> 0</sup> = 1; in SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute
is mandatory and has no default value.  Lastly, the attribute named
"multiplier" can be used to multiply the unit by a real-numbered factor;
this enables the definition of units that are not power-of-ten multiples
of SI units.  For instance, a multiplier of 0.3048 could be used to
define C<foot> as a measure of length in terms of a C<metre>.  The
"multiplier" attribute is optional in SBML Level&nbsp;2, where it has a
default value of C<1> (one); in SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is
mandatory and has not default value.
@if clike
<h3><a class="anchor" name="UnitKind_t">UnitKind_t</a></h3>
@else
<h3><a class="anchor" name="UnitKind_t">%Unit identification codes</a></h3>
@endif@~

As discussed above, SBML defines a set of base units which serves as the
starting point for new unit definitions.  This set of base units
consists of the SI units and a small number of additional convenience
units.

@if clike Until SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3, there
existed a data type in the SBML specifications called C<UnitKind>,
enumerating the possible SBML base units.  Although SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;3 removed this type from the language specification,
libSBML maintains the corresponding enumeration type #UnitKind_t as a
convenience and as a way to provide backward compatibility to previous
SBML Level/Version specifications.  (The removal in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;3 of the enumeration C<UnitKind> was also accompanied by
the redefinition of the data type C<UnitSId> to include the previous @c
UnitKind values as reserved symbols in the C<UnitSId> space.  This
change has no net effect on permissible models, their representation or
their syntax.  The purpose of the change in the SBML specification was
simply to clean up an inconsistency about the contexts in which these
values were usable.)
@endif@if java In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions before
Version&nbsp;3, there existed an enumeration of units called @c
UnitKind.  In Version&nbsp;3, this enumeration was removed and the
identifier class C<UnitSId> redefined to include the previous @c
UnitKind values as reserved symbols.  This change has no net effect on
permissible models, their representation or their syntax.  The purpose
of the change in the SBML specification was simply to clean up an
inconsistency about the contexts in which these values were usable.
However, libSBML maintains UnitKind in the form of of a set of static
integer constants whose names begin with the characters
C<UNIT_KIND_>.  These constants are defined in the class
<code><a href="libsbmlConstants.html">libsbmlConstants</a></code>.
@endif@if python In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions before
Version&nbsp;3, there existed an enumeration of units called @c
UnitKind.  In Version&nbsp;3, this enumeration was removed and the
identifier class C<UnitSId> redefined to include the previous @c
UnitKind values as reserved symbols.  This change has no net effect on
permissible models, their representation or their syntax.  The purpose
of the change in the SBML specification was simply to clean up an
inconsistency about the contexts in which these values were usable.
However, libSBML maintains UnitKind in the form of of a set of static
integer constants whose names begin with the characters
C<UNIT_KIND_>.  These constants are defined in the class
@link libsbml libsbml@endlink.
@endif@~

As a consequence of the fact that libSBML supports models in all Levels
and Versions of SBML, libSBML's set of C<UNIT_KIND_> values is a union
of all the possible base unit names defined in the different SBML
specifications.  However, not every base unit is allowed in every
Level+Version combination of SBML.  Note in particular the following
exceptions:
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\nThe alternate spelling C<"meter"> is included in
addition to the official SI spelling C<"metre">.  This spelling is only
permitted in SBML Level&nbsp;1 models.
\n=item\n\nThe alternate spelling C<"liter"> is included in addition to the
official SI spelling C<"litre">.  This spelling is only permitted in
SBML Level&nbsp;1 models.
\n=item\n\nThe unit C<"Celsius"> is included because of its presence in
specifications of SBML prior to SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3.
\n=item\n\nThe unit C<avogadro> was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3, and
is only permitted for use in SBML Level&nbsp;3 models.

=head2 UnitDefinition

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's UnitDefinition construct.
Units of measurement may be supplied in a number of contexts in an SBML
model.  The SBML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects,
UnitDefinition and Unit.  The approach to defining units in SBML is
compositional; for example, <em>meter second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em> is
constructed by combining a Unit object representing <em>meter</em> with
another Unit object representing <em>second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em>.
The combination is wrapped inside a UnitDefinition, which provides for
assigning an identifier and optional name to the combination.  The
identifier can then be referenced from elsewhere in a model.  Thus, the
UnitDefinition class is the container, and Unit instances are placed
inside UnitDefinition instances.
Two points are worth discussing in the context of SBML units.  First,
unit declarations in SBML models are I<optional>.  The consequence of
this is that a model must be numerically self-consistent independently
of unit declarations, for the benefit of software tools that cannot
interpret or manipulate units.  Unit declarations in SBML are thus more
akin to a type of annotation; they can indicate intentions, and can be
used by model readers for checking the consistency of the model,
labeling simulation output, etc., but any transformations of values
implied by different units must be incorporated I<explicitly> into a
model.

Second, the vast majority of situations that require new SBML unit
definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base units and
factors.  An example is <em>moles per litre per second</em>.  What
distinguishes these sorts of unit definitions from more complex ones is
that they may be expressed without the use of an additive offset from a
zero point.  The use of offsets complicates all unit definition systems,
yet in the domain of SBML, the real-life cases requiring offsets are few
(and in fact, to the best of our knowledge, only involve temperature).
Consequently, the SBML unit system has been consciously designed to
simplify implementation of unit support for the most common cases in
systems biology.  The cost of this simplification is to require units
with offsets to be handled explicitly by the modeler.
@section unitdef-summary Summary of the UnitDefinition construct
UnitDefinition has two attributes and one subelement.  The two
attributes are "id" and "name", and the subelement is ListOfUnits.
The required attribute "id" and optional attribute "name" are both
strings.  The "id" attribute is used to give the defined unit a unique
identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can refer to
it.  The "name" attribute is intended to be used for giving the unit
definition an optional human-readable name.  Please see the <a
href="#unitdef-id">next section</a> for information about the values
permitted for "id".
A UnitDefinition must contain exactly one ListOfUnits, and this list
must contain one or more Unit definitions; see the definitions of these
other object classes for more information about them.  The following
example illustrates a complete unit definition (when written in XML)
when they all the pieces are combined together.  This defines "mmls"
to be millimoles per litre per second.
@verbatim
<listOfUnitDefinitions>
<unitDefinition id="mmls">
<listOfUnits>
<unit kind="mole"   scale="-3"/>
<unit kind="litre"  exponent="-1"/>
<unit kind="second" exponent="-1"/>
</listOfUnits>
</unitDefinition>
</listOfUnitDefinitions>
@endverbatim
@section unitdef-id Special considerations for Unit object identifiers
The attribute "id" in UnitDefinition cannot be given simply any value,
and the precise details of the values permitted differ slightly between
Levels of SBML:
\n=over\n

\n=item\n\nThe "id" of a UnitDefinition must I<not> contain a value from the
list of SBML's predefined base unit names (i.e., the strings C<gram>, @c
litre, etc.).  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, this list consists of the
following:

C<opydetails> doc_base_units
This list of predefined base units is nearly identical in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4, the exception being that Level&nbsp;2 does
not define C<avogadro>.  SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 (and I<only>
this Level+Version combination) provides an additional predefined unit
name, C<Celsius>, not available in Level&nbsp;3.  Finally, SBML
Level&nbsp;1 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;3 provide two more additional
predefined unit names, C<meter> and C<liter>.  This is explained in
somewhat greater detail in the description of the Unit class.
\n=item\n\nIn SBML Level&nbsp;2 (all Versions), there is an additional set of
reserved identifiers: C<substance>, C<volume>, C<area>, C<length>, and
C<time>.  Using one of these values for the attribute "id" of a
UnitDefinition has the effect of redefining the model-wide default units
for the corresponding quantities.  The list of special unit names in
SBML Level&nbsp;2 is given in the table below:
@htmlinclude predefined-units.html
Also, SBML Level&nbsp;2 imposes two limitations on redefining the
predefined unit C<substance>, C<volume>, C<area>, C<length>, and @c
time: (1) The UnitDefinition of a predefined SBML unit can only contain
a single Unit object within it.  (2) The value of the "kind" attribute
in a Unit instance must be drawn from one of the values in the second
column of the table above.
The special unit names C<substance>, C<volume>, C<area>, C<length>, and
C<time> are not defined by SBML Level&nbsp;3, which uses a different
approach to setting model-wide inherited units.
\n=back\n


@section sbml-units-limits Further comments about SBML's unit definition system
The vast majority of modeling situations requiring new SBML unit
definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base units and
factors.  An example of this might be <em>moles per litre per
second</em>.  What distinguishes these sorts of simpler unit definitions
from more complex ones is that they may be expressed without the use of
an additive offset from a zero point.  The use of offsets complicates
all unit definition systems, yet in the domain of SBML the real-life
cases requiring offsets are few (and in fact, to the best of our
knowledge, only involve temperature).  Consequently, the SBML unit
system has been consciously designed in a way that attempts to simplify
implementation of unit support for the most common cases in systems
biology.

As of SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, Unit no longer has the
attribute called "offset" introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;1.  It turned out that the general case involving units
with offsets was incorrectly defined, and few (if any) developers even
attempted to support offset-based units in their software.  In the
development of Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, a consensus among SBML
developers emerged that a fully generalized unit scheme is I<so>
confusing and complicated that it actually I<impedes> interoperability.
SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, Version&nbsp;3 and Version&nbsp;4 acknowledge this
reality by reducing and simplifying the unit system, specifically by
removing the "offset" attribute on Unit and C<Celsius> as a pre-defined
unit.

The following guidelines suggest methods for handling units that do
require the use of zero offsets for their definitions:
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\n<em>Handling Celsius</em>.  A model in which certain quantities are
temperatures measured in degrees Celsius can be converted
straightforwardly to a model in which those temperatures are in
kelvin.  A software tool could do this by performing a straightforward
substitution using the following relationship: <em>T<sub> kelvin</sub> =
T<sub>Celsius</sub> + 273.15</em>.  In every mathematical formula of the
model where a quantity (call it I<x>) in degrees Celsius appears,
replace I<x> with <em>x<sub>k</sub>+ 273.15</em>, where
<em>x<sub>k</sub></em> is now in kelvin.  An alternative approach would 
be to use a FunctionDefinition object to define a function encapsulating this
relationship above and then using that in the rest of the model as
needed.  Since Celsius is a commonly-used unit, software tools could
help users by providing users with the ability to express temperatures
in Celsius in the tools' interfaces, and making substitutions
automatically when writing out the SBML.
\n=item\n\n<em>Other units requiring offsets</em>.  One approach to handling
other kinds of units is to use a FunctionDefinition to define a function
encapsulating the necessary mathematical relationship, then
substituting a call to this function wherever the original quantity
appeared in the model.  For example, here is a possible definition for
converting Fahrenheit to Celsius degrees:
@verbatim
<functionDefinition id="Fahrenheit_to_kelvin">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<lambda>
<bvar><ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci></bvar>
<apply>
<divide/>
<apply>
<plus/>
<ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci>
<cn> 459.67 </cn>
</apply>
<cn> 1.8 </cn>
</apply>
</lambda>
</math>
</functionDefinition>
@endverbatim

\n=item\n\nAn alternative approach not requiring the use of function definitions
is to use an AssignmentRule for each variable in Fahrenheit units.
The AssignmentRule could compute the conversion from Fahrenheit to
(say) kelvin, assign its value to a variable (in Kelvin units), and
then that variable could be used elsewhere in the model.
\n=item\n\nStill another approach is to rewrite the mathematical formulas of a
model to directly incorporate the conversion formula wherever the
original quantity appeared.
\n=back\n

Please consult the SBML specifications for more information about this
and other issues involving units.

=head2 CompartmentType

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Level&nbsp;2's CompartmentType
construct.

SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 provide the <em>compartment
type</em> as a grouping construct that can be used to establish a
relationship between multiple Compartment objects.  A CompartmentType
object only has an identity, and this identity can only be used to
indicate that particular Compartment objects in the model belong to this
type.  This may be useful for conveying a modeling intention, such as
when a model contains many similar compartments, either by their
biological function or the reactions they carry.  Without a compartment
type construct, it would be impossible within SBML itself to indicate
that all of the compartments share an underlying conceptual relationship
because each SBML compartment must be given a unique and separate
identity.  Compartment types have no mathematical meaning in
SBML&mdash;they have no effect on a model's mathematical interpretation.
Simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore
CompartmentType definitions and references to them in a model.
There is no mechanism in SBML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of
compartment types.  One CompartmentType instance cannot be the subtype
of another CompartmentType instance; SBML provides no means of defining
such relationships.
As with other major structures in SBML, CompartmentType has a mandatory
attribute, "id", used to give the compartment type an identifier.  The
identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax
permitted in SBML.  CompartmentType also has an optional "name"
attribute, of type C<string>.  The "id" and "name" must be used
according to the guidelines described in the SBML specification (e.g.,
Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4 specification).
CompartmentType was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
available in SBML Level&nbsp;1 nor in Level&nbsp;3.

polysaccharides, and proteins), and others.
SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 provide an explicit

and other numerical analysis software may ignore SpeciesType definitions
and references to them in a model.
There is no mechanism in SBML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of
species types.  One SpeciesType object cannot be the subtype of another
SpeciesType object; SBML provides no means of defining such
relationships.

=head2 Compartment

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Compartment construct.
A compartment in SBML represents a bounded space in which species are
located.  Compartments do not necessarily have to correspond to actual
structures inside or outside of a biological cell.
It is important to note that although compartments are optional in the
overall definition of Model, every species in an SBML model must be
located in a compartment.  This in turn means that if a model defines
any species, the model must also define at least one compartment.  The
reason is simply that species represent physical things, and therefore
must exist I<somewhere>.  Compartments represent the I<somewhere>.
Compartment has one required attribute, "id", to give the compartment a
unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can
refer to it.  A compartment can also have an optional "name" attribute
of type C<string>.  Identifiers and names must be used according to the
guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
Compartment also has an optional attribute "spatialDimensions" that is
used to indicate the number of spatial dimensions possessed by the
compartment.  Most modeling scenarios involve compartments with integer
values of "spatialDimensions" of C<3> (i.e., a three-dimensional
compartment, which is to say, a volume), or 2 (a two-dimensional
compartment, a surface), or C<1> (a one-dimensional compartment, a
line).  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the type of this attribute is C<double>,
there are no restrictions on the permitted values of the
"spatialDimensions" attribute, and there are no default values.  In SBML
Level&nbsp;2, the value must be a positive C<integer>, and the default
value is C<3>; the permissible values in SBML Level&nbsp;2 are C<3>, @c
2, C<1>, and C<0> (for a point).
Another optional attribute on Compartment is "size", representing the
I<initial> total size of that compartment in the model.  The "size"
attribute must be a floating-point value and may represent a volume (if
the compartment is a three-dimensional one), or an area (if the
compartment is two-dimensional), or a length (if the compartment is
one-dimensional).  There is no default value of compartment size in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;3.  In particular, a missing "size" value
<em>does not imply that the compartment size is 1</em>.  (This is unlike
the definition of compartment "volume" in SBML Level&nbsp;1.)  When the
compartment's "spatialDimensions" attribute does not have a value of @c
0, a missing value of "size" for a given compartment signifies that the
value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or
determined by an InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule or
RateRule elsewhere in the model.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, there are
additional special requirements on the values of "size"; we discuss them
in a <a href="#comp-l2">separate section below</a>.
The units associated with a compartment's "size" attribute value may be
set using the optional attribute "units".  The rules for setting and
using compartment size units differ between SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
Level&nbsp;3, and are discussed separately below.
Finally, the optional Compartment attribute named "constant" is used to
indicate whether the compartment's size stays constant after simulation
begins.  A value of C<true> indicates the compartment's "size" cannot be
changed by any other construct except InitialAssignment; a value of @c
false indicates the compartment's "size" can be changed by other
constructs in SBML.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, there is an additional
explicit restriction that if "spatialDimensions"=C<"0">, the value
cannot be changed by InitialAssignment either.  Further, in
Level&nbsp;2, "constant" has a default value of C<true>.  In SBML
Level&nbsp;3, there is no default value for the "constant" attribute.
@section comp-l2 Additional considerations in SBML Level&nbsp;2
In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the default units of compartment size, and the
kinds of units allowed as values of the attribute "units", interact with
the number of spatial dimensions of the compartment.  The value of the
"units" attribute of a Compartment object must be one of the base units
(see Unit), or the predefined unit identifiers C<volume>, C<area>, @c
length or C<dimensionless>, or a new unit defined by a UnitDefinition
object in the enclosing Model, subject to the restrictions detailed in
the following table:

In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the units of the compartment size, as defined by the
"units" attribute or (if "units" is not set) the default value listed in
the table above, are used in the following ways when the compartment has
a "spatialDimensions" value greater than C<0>:
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\nThe value of the "units" attribute is used as the units of the
compartment identifier when the identifier appears as a numerical
quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML.
\n=item\n\nThe C<math> element of an AssignmentRule or InitialAssignment
referring to this compartment must have identical units.
\n=item\n\nIn RateRule objects that set the rate of change of the compartment's
size, the units of the rule's C<math> element must be identical to the
compartment's "units" attribute divided by the default I<time> units.
(In other words, the units for the rate of change of compartment size
are <em>compartment size</em>/<em>time</em> units.
\n=item\n\nWhen a Species is to be treated in terms of concentrations or
density, the units of the spatial size portion of the concentration
value (i.e., the denominator in the units formula I<substance>/@em
size) are those indicated by the value of the "units" attribute on the
compartment in which the species is located.
\n=back\n

Compartments with "spatialDimensions"=C<0> require special treatment in
this framework.  As implied above, the "size" attribute must not have a
value on an SBML Level&nbsp;2 Compartment object if the
"spatialDimensions" attribute has a value of C<0>.  An additional
related restriction is that the "constant" attribute must default to or
be set to C<true> if the value of the "spatialDimensions" attribute is
C<0>, because a zero-dimensional compartment cannot ever have a size.
If a compartment has no size or dimensional units, how should such a
compartment's identifier be interpreted when it appears in mathematical
formulas?  The answer is that such a compartment's identifier should not
appear in mathematical formulas in the first place&mdash;it has no
value, and its value cannot change.  Note also that a zero-dimensional
compartment is a point, and species located at points can only be
described in terms of amounts, not spatially-dependent measures such as
concentration.  Since SBML KineticLaw formulas are already in terms of
I<substance>/I<time> and not (say) I<concentration>/I<time>, volume
or other factors in principle are not needed for species located in
zero-dimensional compartments.
Finally, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions 2&ndash;4, each compartment in a
model may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular
compartment I<type>.  The optional attribute "compartmentType" is used
identify the compartment type represented by the Compartment structure.
The "compartmentType" attribute's value must be the identifier of a
CompartmentType instance defined in the model.  If the "compartmentType"
attribute is not present on a particular compartment definition, a
unique virtual compartment type is assumed for that compartment, and no
other compartment can belong to that compartment type.  The values of
"compartmentType" attributes on compartments have no effect on the
numerical interpretation of a model.  Simulators and other numerical
analysis software may ignore "compartmentType" attributes.  The
"compartmentType" attribute and the CompartmentType class of objects are
not present in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core nor in SBML Level&nbsp;1.
@section comp-l3 Additional considerations in SBML Level&nbsp;3
One difference between SBML Level&nbsp;3 and lower Levels of SBML is
that there are no restrictions on the permissible values of the
"spatialDimensions" attribute, and there is no default value defined for
the attribute.  The value of "spatialDimensions" does not have to be an
integer, either; this is to allow for the possibility of representing
structures with fractal dimensions.
The number of spatial dimensions possessed by a compartment cannot enter
into mathematical formulas, and therefore cannot directly alter the
numerical interpretation of a model.  However, the value of
"spatialDimensions" I<does> affect the interpretation of the units
associated with a compartment's size.  Specifically, the value of
"spatialDimensions" is used to select among the Model attributes
"volumeUnits", "areaUnits" and "lengthUnits" when a Compartment object
does not define a value for its "units" attribute.
The "units" attribute may be left unspecified for a given compartment in
a model; in that case, the compartment inherits the unit of measurement
specified by one of the attributes on the enclosing Model object
instance.  The applicable attribute on Model depends on the value of the
compartment's "spatialDimensions" attribute; the relationship is shown
in the table below.  If the Model object does not define the relevant
attribute ("volumeUnits", "areaUnits" or "lengthUnits") for a given
"spatialDimensions" value, the unit associated with that Compartment
object's size is undefined.  If I<both> "spatialDimensions" and "units"
are left unset on a given Compartment object instance, then no unit can
be chosen from among the Model's "volumeUnits", "areaUnits" or
"lengthUnits" attributes (even if the Model instance provides values for
those attributes), because there is no basis to select between them and
there is no default value of "spatialDimensions".  Leaving the units of
compartments' sizes undefined in an SBML model does not render the model
invalid; however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend
that all models specify the units of measurement for all compartment
sizes.

The unit of measurement associated with a compartment's size, as defined
by the "units" attribute or (if "units" is not set) the inherited value
from Model according to the table above, is used in the following ways:
\n=over\n

\n=item\n\nWhen the identifier of the compartment appears as a numerical
quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML, it represents
the size of the compartment, and the unit associated with the size is
the value of the "units" attribute.
\n=item\n\nWhen a Species is to be treated in terms of concentrations or
density, the unit associated with the spatial size portion of the
concentration value (i.e., the denominator in the formula
<em>amount</em>/<em>size</em>) is specified by the value of the "units"
attribute on the compartment in which the species is located.
\n=item\n\nThe "math" elements of AssignmentRule, InitialAssignment and
EventAssignment objects setting the value of the compartment size
should all have the same units as the unit associated with the
compartment's size.
\n=item\n\nIn a RateRule object that defines a rate of change for a
compartment's size, the unit of the rule's "math" element should be
identical to the compartment's "units" attribute divided by the
model-wide unit of <em>time</em>.  (In other words, {<em>unit of
compartment size</em>}/{<em>unit of time</em>}.)
\n=back\n


@section comp-other Other aspects of Compartment
In SBML Level&nbsp;1 and Level&nbsp;2, Compartment has an optional
attribute named "outside", whose value can be the identifier of another
Compartment object defined in the enclosing Model object.  Doing so
means that the other compartment contains it or is outside of it.  This
enables the representation of simple topological relationships between
compartments, for those simulation systems that can make use of the
information (e.g., for drawing simple diagrams of compartments).  It is
worth noting that in SBML, there is no relationship between compartment
sizes when compartment positioning is expressed using the "outside"
attribute.  The size of a given compartment does not in any sense
include the sizes of other compartments having it as the value of their
"outside" attributes.  In other words, if a compartment I<B> has the
identifier of compartment I<A> as its "outside" attribute value, the
size of I<A> does not include the size of I<B>.  The compartment sizes
are separate.
In Level&nbsp;2, there are two restrictions on the "outside" attribute.
First, because a compartment with "spatialDimensions" of C<0> has no
size, such a compartment cannot act as the container of any other
compartment I<except> compartments that I<also> have
"spatialDimensions" values of C<0>.  Second, the directed graph formed
by representing Compartment structures as vertexes and the "outside"
attribute values as edges must be acyclic.  The latter condition is
imposed to prevent a compartment from being contained inside itself.  In
the absence of a value for "outside", compartment definitions in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 do not have any implied spatial relationships between each
other.

=head2 Species

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Species construct.
A I<species> in SBML refers to a pool of entities that (a) are
considered indistinguishable from each other for the purposes of the
model, (b) participate in reactions, and (c) are located in a specific
I<compartment>.  The SBML Species object class is intended to represent
these pools.
As with other major constructs in SBML, Species has a mandatory
attribute, "id", used to give the species type an identifier in the
model.  The identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer
syntax permitted in SBML.  Species also has an optional "name"
attribute, of type C<string>.  The "id" and "name" must be used
according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
The required attribute "compartment" is used to identify the compartment
in which the species is located.  The attribute's value must be the
identifier of an existing Compartment object.  It is important to note
that there is no default value for the "compartment" attribute on
Species; every species in an SBML model must be assigned a compartment
I<explicitly>.  (This also implies that every model with one or more
Species objects must define at least one Compartment object.)
@section species-amounts The initial amount and concentration of a species
The optional attributes "initialAmount" and "initialConcentration", both
having a data type of C<double>, can be used to set the I<initial>
quantity of the species in the compartment where the species is located.
These attributes are mutually exclusive; i.e., <em>only one</em> can
have a value on any given instance of a Species object.  Missing
"initialAmount" and "initialConcentration" values implies that their
values either are unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or
determined by an InitialAssignment or other SBML construct elsewhere in
the model.
A species' initial quantity in SBML is set by the "initialAmount" or
"initialConcentration" attribute exactly once.  If the "constant"
attribute is C<true>, then the value of the species' quantity is fixed
and cannot be changed except by an InitialAssignment.  These methods
differ in that the "initialAmount" and "initialConcentration" attributes
can only be used to set the species quantity to a literal floating-point
number, whereas the use of an InitialAssignment object allows the value
to be set using an arbitrary mathematical expression (which, thanks to
MathML's expressiveness, may evaluate to a rational number).  If the
species' "constant" attribute is C<false>, the species' quantity value
may be overridden by an InitialAssignment or changed by AssignmentRule
or AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for <em>t &gt; 0</em>, it may also be
changed by a RateRule, Event objects, and as a result of being a
reactant or product in one or more Reaction objects.  (However, some
constructs are mutually exclusive; see the SBML specifications for the
precise details.)  It is not an error to define "initialAmount" or
"initialConcentration" on a species and also redefine the value using an
InitialAssignment, but the "initialAmount" or "initialConcentration"
setting in that case is ignored.  The SBML specifications provide
additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules and
values for simulation time <em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.
SBML Level&nbsp;2 additionally stipulates that in cases where a species'
compartment has a "spatialDimensions" value of C<0> (zero), the species
cannot have a value for "initialConcentration" because the concepts of
concentration and density break down when a container has zero
dimensions.

@section species-units The units of a species' amount or concentration
When the attribute "initialAmount" is set, the unit of measurement
associated with the value of "initialAmount" is specified by the Species
attribute "substanceUnits".  When the "initialConcentration" attribute
is set, the unit of measurement associated with this concentration value
is {<em>unit of amount</em>} divided by {<em>unit of size</em>}, where
the {<em>unit of amount</em>} is specified by the Species
"substanceUnits" attribute, and the {<em>unit of size</em>} is specified
by the "units" attribute of the Compartment object in which the species
is located.  Note that in either case, a unit of <em>amount</em> is
involved and determined by the "substanceUnits" attribute.  Note
<strong>these two attributes alone do not determine the units of the
species when the species identifier appears in a mathematical
expression</strong>; <em>that</em> aspect is determined by the attribute
"hasOnlySubstanceUnits" discussed below.
In SBML Level&nbsp;3, if the "substanceUnits" attribute is not set on a
given Species object instance, then the unit of <em>amount</em> for that
species is inherited from the "substanceUnits" attribute on the
enclosing Model object instance.  If that attribute on Model is not set
either, then the unit associated with the species' quantity is
undefined.

In SBML Level&nbsp;2, if the "substanceUnits" attribute is not set on a
given Species object instance, then the unit of <em>amount</em> for that
species is taken from the predefined SBML unit identifier @c
"substance".  The value assigned to "substanceUnits" must be chosen from
one of the following possibilities: one of the base unit identifiers
defined in SBML, the built-in unit identifier C<"substance">, or the
identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit definitions in the
enclosing Model object.  The chosen units for "substanceUnits" must be
be C<"dimensionless">, C<"mole">, C<"item">, C<"kilogram">, C<"gram">,
or units derived from these.
As noted at the beginning of this section, simply setting
"initialAmount" or "initialConcentration" alone does I<not> determine
whether a species identifier represents an amount or a concentration
when it appears elsewhere in an SBML model.  The role of the attribute
"hasOnlySubstanceUnits" is to indicate whether the units of the species,
when the species identifier appears in mathematical formulas, are
intended to be concentration or amount.  The attribute takes on a
boolean value.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute has no default value
and must always be set in a model; in SBML Level&nbsp;2, it has a
default value of C<false>.
The <em>units of the species</em> are used in the following ways:
\n=over\n

\n=item\n\nWhen the species' identifier appears in a MathML formula, it
represents the species' quantity, and the unit of measurement associated
with the quantity is as described above.
\n=item\n\nThe "math" elements of AssignmentRule, InitialAssignment and
EventAssignment objects referring to this species should all have the
same units as the unit of measurement associated with the species
quantity.

\n=item\n\nIn a RateRule object that defines the rate of change of the
species' quantity, the unit associated with the rule's "math" element
should be equal to the unit of the species' quantity divided by the
model-wide unit of <em>time</em>; in other words, {<em>unit of species
quantity</em>}/{<em>unit of time</em>}.
\n=back\n


@section species-constant The "constant" and "boundaryCondition" attributes
The Species object class has two boolean attributes named "constant" and
"boundaryCondition", used to indicate whether and how the quantity of
that species can vary during a simulation.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 they
are optional; in SBML Level&nbsp;3 they are mandatory.  The following
table shows how to interpret the combined values of these attributes.
@htmlinclude species-boundarycondition.html
By default, when a species is a product or reactant of one or more
reactions, its quantity is determined by those reactions.  In SBML, it
is possible to indicate that a given species' quantity is <em>not</em>
determined by the set of reactions even when that species occurs as a
product or reactant; i.e., the species is on the <em>boundary</em> of
the reaction system, and its quantity is not determined by the
reactions.  The boolean attribute "boundaryCondition" can be used to
indicate this.  A value of C<false> indicates that the species I<is>
part of the reaction system.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute has a
default value of C<false>, while in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it has no
default.

The "constant" attribute indicates whether the species' quantity can be
changed at all, regardless of whether by reactions, rules, or constructs
other than InitialAssignment.  A value of C<false> indicates that the
species' quantity can be changed.  (This is also a common value because
the purpose of most simulations is precisely to calculate changes in
species quantities.)  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute has a default
value of C<false>, while in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it has no default.  Note
that the initial quantity of a species can be set by an
InitialAssignment irrespective of the value of the "constant" attribute.
In practice, a "boundaryCondition" value of C<true> means a differential
equation derived from the reaction definitions should not be generated
for the species.  However, the species' quantity may still be changed by
AssignmentRule, RateRule, AlgebraicRule, Event, and InitialAssignment
constructs if its "constant" attribute is C<false>.  Conversely, if the
species' "constant" attribute is C<true>, then its value cannot be
changed by anything except InitialAssignment.
A species having "boundaryCondition"=C<false> and "constant"=C<false>
can appear as a product and/or reactant of one or more reactions in the
model.  If the species is a reactant or product of a reaction, it must
I<not> also appear as the target of any AssignmentRule or RateRule
object in the model.  If instead the species has "boundaryCondition"=@c
false and "constant"=C<true>, then it cannot appear as a reactant or
product, or as the target of any AssignmentRule, RateRule or
EventAssignment object in the model.
@section species-l2-convfactor The conversionFactor attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;3
In SBML Level&nbsp;3, Species has an additional optional attribute,
"conversionFactor", that defines a conversion factor that applies to a
particular species.  The value must be the identifier of a Parameter
object instance defined in the model.  That Parameter object must be a
constant, meaning its "constant" attribute must be set to C<true>.
If a given Species object definition defines a value for its
"conversionFactor" attribute, it takes precedence over any factor
defined by the Model object's "conversionFactor" attribute.
The unit of measurement associated with a species' quantity can be
different from the unit of extent of reactions in the model.  SBML
Level&nbsp;3 avoids implicit unit conversions by providing an explicit
way to indicate any unit conversion that might be required.  The use of
a conversion factor in computing the effects of reactions on a species'
quantity is explained in detail in the SBML Level&nbsp;3 specification
document.  Because the value of the "conversionFactor" attribute is the
identifier of a Parameter object, and because parameters can have units
attached to them, the transformation from reaction extent units to
species units can be completely specified using this approach.
Note that the unit conversion factor is <strong>only applied when
calculating the effect of a reaction on a species</strong>.  It is not
used in any rules or other SBML constructs that affect the species, and
it is also not used when the value of the species is referenced in a
mathematical expression.
@section species-l2-type The speciesType attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4
In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4, each species in a model
may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular species type.
The optional attribute "speciesType" is used to identify the species
type of the chemical entities that make up the pool represented by the
Species objects.  The attribute's value must be the identifier of an
existing SpeciesType object in the model.  If the "speciesType"
attribute is not present on a particular species definition, it means
the pool contains chemical entities of a type unique to that pool; in
effect, a virtual species type is assumed for that species, and no other
species can belong to that species type.  The value of "speciesType"
attributes on species have no effect on the numerical interpretation of
a model; simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore
"speciesType" attributes.
There can be only one species of a given species type in any given
compartment of a model.  More specifically, for all Species objects
having a value for the "speciesType" attribute, the pair
<center>
("speciesType" attribute value, "compartment" attribute value)
</center>

must be unique across the set of all Species object in a model.
@section species-other The spatialSizeUnits attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;1&ndash;2
In versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2 before Version&nbsp;3, the class
Species included an attribute called "spatialSizeUnits", which allowed
explicitly setting the units of size for initial concentration.  LibSBML
retains this attribute for compatibility with older definitions of
Level&nbsp;2, but its use is strongly discouraged because many software
tools do no properly interpret this unit declaration and it is
incompatible with all SBML specifications after Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;3.


@section species-math Additional considerations for interpreting the numerical value of a species
Species are unique in SBML in that they have a kind of duality: a
species identifier may stand for either substance amount (meaning, a
count of the number of individual entities) or a concentration or
density (meaning, amount divided by a compartment size).  The previous
sections explain the meaning of a species identifier when it is
referenced in a mathematical formula or in rules or other SBML
constructs; however, it remains to specify what happens to a species
when the compartment in which it is located changes in size.
When a species definition has a "hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute value
of C<false> and the size of the compartment in which the species is
located changes, the default in SBML is to assume that it is the
concentration that must be updated to account for the size change.  This
follows from the principle that, all other things held constant, if a
compartment simply changes in size, the size change does not in itself
cause an increase or decrease in the number of entities of any species
in that compartment.  In a sense, the default is that the I<amount> of
a species is preserved across compartment size changes.  Upon such size
changes, the value of the concentration or density must be recalculated
from the simple relationship <em>concentration = amount / size</em> if
the value of the concentration is needed (for example, if the species
identifier appears in a mathematical formula or is otherwise referenced
in an SBML construct).  There is one exception: if the species' quantity
is determined by an AssignmentRule, RateRule, AlgebraicRule, or an
EventAssignment and the species has a "hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute
value of C<false>, it means that the <em>concentration</em> is assigned
by the rule or event; in that case, the <em>amount</em> must be
calculated when the compartment size changes.  (Events also require
additional care in this situation, because an event with multiple
assignments could conceivably reassign both a species quantity and a
compartment size simultaneously.  Please refer to the SBML
specifications for the details.)
Note that the above only matters if a species has a
"hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute value of C<false>, meaning that the
species identifier refers to a concentration wherever the identifier
appears in a mathematical formula.  If instead the attribute's value is
C<true>, then the identifier of the species <em>always</em> stands for
an amount wherever it appears in a mathematical formula or is referenced
by an SBML construct.  In that case, there is never a question about
whether an assignment or event is meant to affect the amount or
concentration: it is always the amount.
A particularly confusing situation can occur when the species has
"constant" attribute value of C<true> in combination with a
"hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute value of C<false>.  Suppose this
species is given a value for "initialConcentration".  Does a "constant"
value of C<true> mean that the concentration is held constant if the
compartment size changes?  No; it is still the amount that is kept
constant across a compartment size change.  The fact that the species
was initialized using a concentration value is irrelevant.

=item Species::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units
of this Species' amount or concentration.
Species in SBML have an attribute ("substanceUnits") for declaring the
units of measurement intended for the species' amount or concentration
(depending on which one applies).  In the absence of a value given for
"substanceUnits", the units are taken from the enclosing Model's
definition of C<"substance"> or C<"substance">/<em>(size of the
compartment)</em> in which the species is located, or finally, if
these are not redefined by the Model, the relevant SBML default units
for those quantities.  Following that procedure, the method
@if java Species::getDerivedUnitDefinition()@else getDerivedUnitDefinition()@endif@~
returns a UnitDefinition based on the
interpreted units of this species's amount or concentration.
Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends 
on the model as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not 
been added to a model or the model itself is incomplete,
unit analysis is not possible and this method will return C<NULL>.
Note also that unit declarations for Species are in terms of the @em
identifier of a unit, but this method returns a UnitDefinition object,
not a unit identifier.  It does this by constructing an appropriate
UnitDefinition.  Callers may find this particularly useful when used
in conjunction with the helper methods on UnitDefinition for comparing
different UnitDefinition objects.
In SBML Level&nbsp;2 specifications prior to Version&nbsp;3, Species
includes an additional attribute named "spatialSizeUnits", which
allows explicitly setting the units of size for initial concentration.
The @if java Species::getDerivedUnitDefinition()@else getDerivedUnitDefinition()@endif@~
takes this into account for models
expressed in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2.
@return a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of this 
Species, or C<NULL> if one cannot be constructed.

=head2 Parameter

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Parameter construct.
A Parameter is used in SBML to define a symbol associated with a value;
this symbol can then be used in mathematical formulas in a model.  By
default, parameters have constant value for the duration of a
simulation, and for this reason are called I<parameters> instead of @em
variables in SBML, although it is crucial to understand that <em>SBML
parameters represent both concepts</em>.  Whether a given SBML
parameter is intended to be constant or variable is indicated by the
value of its "constant" attribute.
SBML's Parameter has a required attribute, "id", that gives the
parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
definition can refer to it.  A parameter can also have an optional
"name" attribute of type C<string>.  Identifiers and names must be used
according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
The optional attribute "value" determines the value (of type C<double>)
assigned to the parameter.  A missing value for "value" implies that
the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source,
or determined by an initial assignment.  The unit of measurement
associated with the value of the parameter can be specified using the
optional attribute "units".  Here we only mention briefly some notable
points about the possible unit choices, but readers are urged to consult
the SBML specification documents for more information:
\n=over\n

\n=item\n\nIn SBML Level&nbsp;3, there are no constraints on the units that
can be assigned to parameters in a model; there are also no units to
inherit from the enclosing Model object (unlike the case for, e.g.,
Species and Compartment).
\n=item\n\nIn SBML Level&nbsp;2, the value assigned to the parameter's "units"
attribute must be chosen from one of the following possibilities: one of
the base unit identifiers defined in SBML; one of the built-in unit
identifiers C<"substance">, C<"time">, C<"volume">, C<"area"> or @c
"length"; or the identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit
definitions in the enclosing Model structure.  There are no constraints
on the units that can be chosen from these sets.  There are no default
units for parameters.
\n=back\n

The Parameter structure has another boolean attribute named "constant"
that is used to indicate whether the parameter's value can vary during a
simulation.  (In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is mandatory and must
be given a value; in SBML Levels below Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is
optional.)  A value of C<true> indicates the parameter's value cannot be
changed by any construct except InitialAssignment.  Conversely, if the
value of "constant" is C<false>, other constructs in SBML, such as rules
and events, can change the value of the parameter.
SBML Level&nbsp;3 uses a separate object class, LocalParameter, for
parameters that are local to a Reaction's KineticLaw.  In Levels prior
to SBML Level&nbsp;3, the Parameter class is used both for definitions
of global parameters, as well as reaction-local parameters stored in a
list within KineticLaw objects.  Parameter objects that are local to a
reaction (that is, those defined within the KineticLaw structure of a
Reaction) cannot be changed by rules and therefore are <em>implicitly
always constant</em>; consequently, in SBML Level&nbsp;2, parameter
definitions within Reaction structures should I<not> have their
"constant" attribute set to C<false>.
What if a global parameter has its "constant" attribute set to C<false>,
but the model does not contain any rules, events or other constructs
that ever change its value over time?  Although the model may be
suspect, this situation is not strictly an error.  A value of C<false>
for "constant" only indicates that a parameter I<can> change value, not
that it I<must>.
As with all other major SBML components, Parameter is derived from
SBase, and the methods defined on SBase are available on Parameter.
@note The use of the term I<parameter> in SBML sometimes leads to
confusion among readers who have a particular notion of what something
called "parameter" should be.  It has been the source of heated debate,
but despite this, no one has yet found an adequate replacement term that
does not have different connotations to different people and hence leads
to confusion among I<some> subset of users.  Perhaps it would have been
better to have two constructs, one called I<constants> and the other
called I<variables>.  The current approach in SBML is simply more
parsimonious, using a single Parameter construct with the boolean flag
"constant" indicating which flavor it is.  In any case, readers are
implored to look past their particular definition of a I<parameter> and
simply view SBML's Parameter as a single mechanism for defining both
constants and (additional) variables in a model.  (We write @em
additional because the species in a model are usually considered to be
the central variables.)  After all, software tools are not required to
expose to users the actual names of particular SBML constructs, and
thus tools can present to their users whatever terms their designers
feel best matches their target audience.

=head2 LocalParameter

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;3's LocalParameter
construct.

LocalParameter has been introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3 to serve as the
object class for parameter definitions that are intended to be local to
a Reaction.  Objects of class LocalParameter never appear at the Model
level; they are always contained within ListOfLocalParameters lists
which are in turn contained within KineticLaw objects.
Like its global Parameter counterpart, the LocalParameter object class
is used to define a symbol associated with a value; this symbol can then
be used in a model's mathematical formulas (and specifically, for
LocalParameter, reaction rate formulas).  Unlike Parameter, the
LocalParameter class does not have a "constant" attribute: local
parameters within reactions are I<always> constant.
LocalParameter has one required attribute, "id", to give the
parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
definition can refer to it.  A parameter can also have an optional
"name" attribute of type C<string>.  Identifiers and names must be used
according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
The optional attribute "value" determines the value (of type C<double>)
assigned to the parameter.  A missing value for "value" implies that
the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source,
or determined by an initial assignment.  The unit of measurement
associated with the value of the parameter can be specified using the
optional attribute "units".  Here we only mention briefly some notable
points about the possible unit choices, but readers are urged to consult
the SBML specification documents for more information:
\n=over\n

\n=item\n\nIn SBML Level&nbsp;3, there are no constraints on the units that
can be assigned to parameters in a model; there are also no units to
inherit from the enclosing Model object.
\n=item\n\nIn SBML Level&nbsp;2, the value assigned to the parameter's "units"
attribute must be chosen from one of the following possibilities: one of
the base unit identifiers defined in SBML; one of the built-in unit
identifiers C<"substance">, C<"time">, C<"volume">, C<"area"> or @c
"length"; or the identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit
definitions in the enclosing Model structure.  There are no constraints
on the units that can be chosen from these sets.  There are no default
units for local parameters.
\n=back\n

As with all other major SBML components, LocalParameter is derived from
SBase, and the methods defined on SBase are available on LocalParameter.
@warning <span class="warning">LibSBML derives LocalParameter from
Parameter; however, this does not precisely match the object hierarchy
defined by SBML Level&nbsp;3, where LocalParameter is derived directly
from SBase and not Parameter.  We believe this arrangement makes it easier
for libSBML users to program applications that work with both SBML
Level&nbsp;2 and SBML Level&nbsp;3, but programmers should also keep in
mind this difference exists.  A side-effect of libSBML's scheme is that
certain methods on LocalParameter that are inherited from Parameter do not

=head2 InitialAssignment

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's InitialAssignment construct.
SBML Level 2 Versions 2&ndash;4 and SBML Level&nbsp;3 provide two ways of assigning initial
values to entities in a model.  The simplest and most basic is to set
the values of the appropriate attributes in the relevant components; for
example, the initial value of a model parameter (whether it is a
constant or a variable) can be assigned by setting its "value" attribute
directly in the model definition.  However, this approach is not
suitable when the value must be calculated, because the initial value
attributes on different components such as species, compartments, and
parameters are single values and not mathematical expressions.  In those
situations, the InitialAssignment construct can be used; it permits the
calculation of the value of a constant or the initial value of a
variable from the values of I<other> quantities in a model.
As explained below, the provision of InitialAssignment does not mean
that models necessarily must use this construct when defining initial
values of quantities in a model.  If a value can be set directly using
the relevant attribute of a component in a model, then that
approach may be more efficient and more portable to other software
tools.  InitialAssignment should be used when the other mechanism is
insufficient for the needs of a particular model.
The InitialAssignment construct has some similarities to AssignmentRule.
The main differences are: (a) an InitialAssignment can set the value of
a constant whereas an AssignmentRule cannot, and (b) unlike
AssignmentRule, an InitialAssignment definition only applies up to and
including the beginning of simulation time, i.e., <em>t \f$\leq\f$ 0</em>,
while an AssignmentRule applies at all times.
InitialAssignment has a required attribute, "symbol", whose value must
follow the guidelines for identifiers described in the SBML
specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
specification).  The value of this attribute in an InitialAssignment
object can be the identifier of a Compartment, Species or global
Parameter elsewhere in the model.  The InitialAssignment defines the
initial value of the constant or variable referred to by the "symbol"
attribute.  (The attribute's name is "symbol" rather than "variable"
because it may assign values to constants as well as variables in a
model.)  Note that an initial assignment cannot be made to reaction
identifiers, that is, the "symbol" attribute value of an
InitialAssignment cannot be an identifier that is the "id" attribute
value of a Reaction object in the model.  This is identical to a
restriction placed on rules.
InitialAssignment also has a required "math" subelement that contains a
MathML expression used to calculate the value of the constant or the
initial value of the variable.  The units of the value computed by the
formula in the "math" subelement should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be identical to be the
units associated with the identifier given in the "symbol" attribute.
(That is, the units are the units of the species, compartment, or
parameter, as appropriate for the kind of object identified by the value
of "symbol".)
InitialAssignment was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
available in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 nor in any version of Level 1.
@section initassign-semantics Semantics of Initial Assignments
The value calculated by an InitialAssignment object overrides the value
assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that symbol.  For
example, if a compartment's "size" attribute is set in its definition,
and the model also contains an InitialAssignment having that
compartment's identifier as its "symbol" attribute value, then the
interpretation is that the "size" assigned in the Compartment object
should be ignored and the value assigned based on the computation
defined in the InitialAssignment.  Initial assignments can take place
for Compartment, Species and global Parameter objects regardless of the
value of their "constant" attribute.
The actions of all InitialAssignment objects are in general terms
the same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type
of variable being set:
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\n<em>In the case of a species</em>, an InitialAssignment sets the
referenced species' initial quantity (concentration or amount of
substance) to the value determined by the formula in the "math"
subelement.    The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
as the units specified for the species.
\n=item\n\n<em>In the case of a compartment</em>, an InitialAssignment sets
the referenced compartment's initial size to the size determined by the
formula in "math".  The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
as the units specified for the size of the compartment.
\n=item\n\n<em>In the case of a parameter</em>, an InitialAssignment sets the
referenced parameter's initial value to that determined by the formula
in "math".  The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
as the units defined for the parameter.  \n=back\n
In the context of a simulation, initial assignments establish values
that are in effect prior to and including the start of simulation time,
i.e., <em>t \f$\leq\f$ 0</em>.  Section 3.4.8 in the SBML Level 2
Version 4  and SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specifications provides information about the interpretation of
assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time up to and
including the start time <em>t = 0</em>; this is important for
establishing the initial conditions of a simulation if the model
involves expressions containing the <em>delay</em> "csymbol".
There cannot be two initial assignments for the same symbol in a model;
that is, a model must not contain two or more InitialAssignment objects
that both have the same identifier as their "symbol" attribute value.  A
model must also not define initial assignments <em>and</em> assignment
rules for the same entity.  That is, there cannot be <em>both</em> an
InitialAssignment and an AssignmentRule for the same symbol in a model,
because both kinds of constructs apply prior to and at the start of
simulated time&mdash;allowing both to exist for a given symbol would
result in indeterminism).
The ordering of InitialAssignment objects is not significant.  The
combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
objects form a set of assignment statements that must be considered as a
whole.  The combined set of assignment statements should not contain
algebraic loops: a chain of dependency between these statements should
terminate.  (More formally, consider the directed graph of assignment
statements where nodes are a model's assignment statements and directed
arcs exist for each occurrence of a symbol in an assignment statement
"math" attribute.  The directed arcs in this graph start from the
statement assigning the symbol and end at the statement that contains
the symbol in their math elements.  Such a graph must be acyclic.)
Finally, it is worth being explicit about the expected behavior in the
following situation.  Suppose (1) a given symbol has a value <em>x</em>
assigned to it in its definition, and (2) there is an initial assignment
having the identifier as its "symbol" value and reassigning the value to
<em>y</em>, <em>and</em> (3) the identifier is also used in the
mathematical formula of a second initial assignment.  What value should
the second initial assignment use?  It is <em>y</em>, the value assigned
to the symbol by the first initial assignment, not whatever value was
given in the symbol's definition.  This follows directly from the
behavior described above: if an InitialAssignment object exists for a
given symbol, then the symbol's value is overridden by that initial
assignment.

=head2 Rule

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Rule construct.
In SBML, I<rules> provide additional ways to define the values of
variables in a model, their relationships, and the dynamical behaviors
of those variables.  They enable encoding relationships that cannot be
expressed using Reaction nor InitialAssignment objects alone.
The libSBML implementation of rules mirrors the SBML Level&nbsp;3
Version&nbsp;1 Core definition (which is in turn is very similar to the
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 definition), with Rule being the parent
class of three subclasses as explained below.  The Rule class itself
cannot be instantiated by user programs and has no constructor; only the
subclasses AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and RateRule can be
instantiated directly.

=head2 AlgebraicRule

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's AlgebraicRule construct.
The rule type AlgebraicRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It
is used to express equations that are neither assignments of model
variables nor rates of change.  AlgebraicRule does not add any
attributes to the basic Rule; its role is simply to distinguish this
case from the other cases.
In the context of a simulation, algebraic rules are in effect at all
times, <em>t</em> \f$\geq\f$ <em>0</em>.  For purposes of evaluating
expressions that involve the delay "csymbol" (see the SBML
specification), algebraic rules are considered to apply also at
<em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant SBML
specification for additional information about the semantics of
assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
\f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.
An SBML model must not be overdetermined.  The ability to define
arbitrary algebraic expressions in an SBML model introduces the
possibility that a model is mathematically overdetermined by the overall
system of equations constructed from its rules, reactions and events.
Therefore, if an algebraic rule is introduced in a model, for at least
one of the entities referenced in the rule's "math" element the value of
that entity must not be completely determined by other constructs in the
model.  This means that at least this entity must not have the attribute
"constant"=C<true> and there must also not be a rate rule or assignment
rule for it.  Furthermore, if the entity is a Species object, its value
must not be determined by reactions, which means that it must either
have the attribute "boundaryCondition"=C<true> or else not be involved
in any reaction at all.  These restrictions are explained in more detail
in the SBML specification documents.
In SBML Levels 2 and&nbsp;3, Reaction object identifiers can be
referenced in the "math" expression of an algebraic rule, but reaction
rates can never be <em>determined</em> by algebraic rules.  This is true
even when a reaction does not contain a KineticLaw element.  (In such
cases of missing KineticLaw elements, the model is valid but incomplete;
the rates of reactions lacking kinetic laws are simply undefined, and
not determined by the algebraic rule.)

=head2 AssignmentRule

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's AssignmentRule construct.
The rule type AssignmentRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It
is used to express equations that set the values of variables.  The
left-hand side (the attribute named "variable") of an assignment rule
can refer to the identifier of a Species, SpeciesReference (in SBML
Level&nbsp;3), Compartment, or Parameter object in the model (but not a
Reaction).  The entity identified must have its "constant" attribute set
to C<false>.  The effects of an AssignmentRule are in general terms the
same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type of
variable being set: \n=over\n
\n=item\n\n<em>In the case of a species</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the
referenced species' quantity (whether a "concentration" or "amount") to
the value determined by the formula in the MathML subelement "math".
The unit associated with the value produced by the "math" formula @em
should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or I<must> (in
SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2 version&nbsp;4) be equal to the unit
associated with the species' quantity.  <em>Restrictions</em>: There
must not be both an AssignmentRule "variable" attribute and a
SpeciesReference "species" attribute having the same value, unless the
referenced Species object has its "boundaryCondition" attribute set to
C<true>.  In other words, an assignment rule cannot be defined for a
species that is created or destroyed in a reaction unless that species
is defined as a boundary condition in the model.
\n=item\n\n(For SBML Level&nbsp;3 only) <em>In the case of a species
reference</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the stoichiometry of the
referenced reactant or product to the value determined by the formula in
"math".  The unit associated with the value produced by the "math"
formula should be consistent with the unit "dimensionless", because
reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless
quantities.

\n=item\n\n<em>In the case of a compartment</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the
referenced compartment's size to the value determined by the formula in
the "math" subelement of the AssignmentRule object.  The overall units
of the formula in "math" I<should> (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4
and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or I<must> (in SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2
version&nbsp;4) be the same as the units of the size of the compartment.
\n=item\n\n<em>In the case of a parameter</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the
referenced parameter's value to that determined by the formula in the
"math" subelement of the AssignmentRule object.  The overall units of
the formula in the "math" subelement I<should> (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or I<must> (in SBML releases prior to
Level&nbsp;2 version&nbsp;4) be the same as the units defined for the
parameter.  \n=back\n
In the context of a simulation, assignment rules are in effect at all
times, <em>t</em> \f$\geq\f$ <em>0</em>.  For purposes of evaluating
expressions that involve the <em>delay</em> "csymbol" (see the SBML
Level&nbsp;2 specification), assignment rules are considered to apply
also at <em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant
SBML specification for additional information about the semantics of
assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
\f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.
A model must not contain more than one AssignmentRule or RateRule
object having the same value of "variable"; in other words, in the set
of all assignment rules and rate rules in an SBML model, each variable
appearing in the left-hand sides can only appear once.  This simply
follows from the fact that an indeterminate system would result if a
model contained more than one assignment rule for the same variable or
both an assignment rule and a rate rule for the same variable.
Similarly, a model must also not contain <em>both</em> an AssignmentRule
and an InitialAssignment for the same variable, because both kinds of
constructs apply prior to and at the start of simulation time, i.e.,
<em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.  If a model contained both an initial
assignment and an assignment rule for the same variable, an
indeterminate system would result.
The value calculated by an AssignmentRule object overrides the value
assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that symbol.  For
example, if a Compartment object's "size" attribute value is set in its
definition, and the model also contains an AssignmentRule object having
that compartment's "id" as its "variable" value, then the "size"
assigned in the Compartment object definition is ignored and the value
assigned based on the computation defined in the AssignmentRule.  This
does <em>not</em> mean that a definition for a given symbol can be
omitted if there is an AssignmentRule object for it.  For example, there
must be a Parameter definition for a given parameter if there is an
AssignmentRule for that parameter.  It is only a question of which value
definition takes precedence.

=head2 Constraint

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Constraint construct.
The Constraint object class was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;2 as a mechanism for stating the assumptions under which a
model is designed to operate.  The <em>constraints</em> are statements
about permissible values of different quantities in a model.
Constraints are not used to compute dynamical values for simulation or
analysis, but rather, they serve an advisory role for
simulation/analysis tools.
SBML's Constraint object class has one required attribute, "id", to
give the parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML
model definition can refer to it.  A Constraint object can also have an
optional "name" attribute of type C<string>.  Identifiers and names must
be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML specification
(e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level&nbsp;2 Version 4 specification).  
Constraint has one required subelement, "math", containing a MathML
formula defining the condition of the constraint.  This formula must
return a boolean value of C<true> when the model is a <em>valid</em>
state.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the
variables and other entities in an SBML model.  The evaluation of "math"
and behavior of constraints are described in more detail below.
A Constraint structure also has an optional subelement called "message".
This can contain a message in XHTML format that may be displayed to the
user when the condition of the formula in the "math" subelement
evaluates to a value of C<false>.  Software tools are not required to
display the message, but it is recommended that they do so as a matter
of best practice.  The XHTML content within a "message" subelement must
follow the same restrictions as for the "notes" element on SBase
described in in the SBML Level&nbsp;2 specification; please consult the
<a target="_blank" href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">SBML
specification document</a> corresponding to the SBML Level and Version
of your model for more information about the requirements for "notes"
content.

Constraint was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2.  It is
not available in earlier versions of Level&nbsp;2 nor in any version of
Level&nbsp;1.

@section constraint-semantics Semantics of Constraints
In the context of a simulation, a Constraint has effect at all times
<em>t \f$\geq\f$ 0</em>.  Each Constraint's "math" subelement is first
evaluated after any InitialAssignment definitions in a model at <em>t =
0</em> and can conceivably trigger at that point.  (In other words, a
simulation could fail a constraint immediately.)
Constraint structures <em>cannot and should not</em> be used to compute
the dynamical behavior of a model as part of, for example, simulation.
Constraints may be used as input to non-dynamical analysis, for instance
by expressing flux constraints for flux balance analysis.
The results of a simulation of a model containing a constraint are
invalid from any simulation time at and after a point when the function
given by the "math" subelement returns a value of C<false>.  Invalid
simulation results do not make a prediction of the behavior of the
biochemical reaction network represented by the model.  The precise
behavior of simulation tools is left undefined with respect to
constraints.  If invalid results are detected with respect to a given
constraint, the "message" subelement may optionally be displayed to the
user.  The simulation tool may also halt the simulation or clearly
delimit in output data the simulation time point at which the simulation
results become invalid.
SBML does not impose restrictions on duplicate Constraint definitions or
the order of evaluation of Constraint objects in a model.  It is
possible for a model to define multiple constraints all with the same
mathematical expression.  Since the failure of any constraint indicates
that the model simulation has entered an invalid state, a system is not
required to attempt to detect whether other constraints in the model
have failed once any one constraint has failed.

=head2 Reaction

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Reaction construct.
A I<reaction> represents any transformation, transport or binding
process, typically a chemical reaction, that can change the quantity of
one or more species.  In SBML, a reaction is defined primarily in terms
of the participating reactants and products (and their corresponding
stoichiometries), along with optional modifier species, an optional rate
at which the reaction takes place, and optional parameters.  
As with other major object in SBML, Reaction has a mandatory attribute,
"id", used to give the compartment type an identifier.  The identifier
must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax permitted in
SBML.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3, the reaction "id"
identifier can be used in mathematical formulas elsewhere in an SBML
model to represent the rate of that reaction; this usage is explained
below.  Reaction also has an optional "name" attribute, of type @c
string.  The "id" and "name" must be used according to the guidelines
described in the SBML specification.
The species participating as reactants, products, and/or modifiers in a
reaction are declared using lists of SpeciesReference and/or
ModifierSpeciesReference instances stored in subelements
"listOfReactants", "listOfProducts" and "listOfModifiers".  Certain
restrictions are placed on the appearance of species in reaction
definitions:
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\nThe ability of a species to appear as a reactant or product of any
reaction in a model is governed by certain flags in that species'
definition; see the definition of Species for more information.
\n=item\n\nAny species appearing in the mathematical formula of the subelement
"kineticLaw" (described below) of a Reaction must be declared in at
least one of that Reaction's lists of reactants, products, and/or
modifiers.  Put another way, it is an error for a reaction's kinetic law
formula to refer to species that have not been declared for that
reaction.

\n=item\n\nA reaction definition can contain an empty list of reactants
<em>or</em> an empty list of products, but it must have at least one
reactant or product; in other words, a reaction without any reactant or
product species is not permitted.  (This restriction does not apply to
modifier species, which remain optional in all cases.)
\n=back\n

A reaction can contain up to one KineticLaw object in a subelement named
"kineticLaw".  It defines the speed at which the process defined by the
reaction takes place.  The description of KineticLaw provides more
details about its use.  Note that although the inclusion of a KineticLaw
object in an instance of a Reaction component is optional, there is no
useful default that can be substituted in place of a missing rate
expression in a reaction.  Moreover, a reaction's rate cannot be defined
in any other way in SBML&mdash;InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule,
RateRule, AlgebraicRule, Event, and other constructs in SBML cannot be
used to set the reaction rate separately.  Nevertheless, for some
modeling applications, reactions without any defined rate can be
perfectly acceptable.
Reaction also has a boolean attribute named "reversible" for indicating
whether the reaction is reversible.  This attribute is optional in SBML
Level&nbsp;2, with a default of C<true>; it is mandatory in SBML
Level&nbsp;3 (with no default value).  To say that a reaction is @em
reversible is to say it can proceed in either the forward or the reverse
direction.  Although the reversibility of a reaction can sometimes be
deduced by inspecting its rate expression, this is not always the case,
especially for complicated expressions.  Moreover, the need in SBML to
allow rate expressions (i.e., KineticLaw) to be optional leads to the
need for a separate flag indicating reversibility.  Note that labeling a
reaction as irreversible is an assertion that the reaction always
proceeds in the given forward direction.  (Why else would it be flagged
as irreversible?)  This implies the rate expression in the KineticLaw
always has a non-negative value during simulations.  Software tools
could provide a means of optionally testing that this condition holds.
The presence of reversibility information in two places (i.e., the rate
expression and the "reversible" attribute on Reaction) leaves open the
possibility that a model could contain contradictory information, but
the creation of such a model would be an error on the part of the
software generating it.
The Reaction object class has another boolean attribute called "fast".
This attribute is optional in SBML Level&nbsp;2, with a default of @c
false; it is mandatory in SBML Level&nbsp;3 (with no default value).  It
is used to indicate that a reaction occurs on a vastly faster time scale
than others in a system.  Readers are directed to the SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;4 specification, which provides more detail about the
conditions under which a reaction can be considered to be fast in this
sense.  The attribute's default value is C<false>.  SBML Level&nbsp;1
and Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 incorrectly claimed that software tools
could ignore this attribute if they did not implement support for the
corresponding concept; however, further research in SBML has revealed
that this is not true, and "fast" <em>cannot be ignored</em> if it is
set to C<true>.  SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 therefore
stipulate that if a model has any reactions with "fast" set to C<true>,
a software tool must be able to respect the attribute or else indicate
to the user that it does not have the capacity to do so.  Analysis
software cannot ignore the value of the "fast" attribute because doing
so may lead to different results as compared to a software system that
<em>does</em> make use of "fast".
In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1, the Reaction object has an
additional optional attribute named "compartment", whose value must be
the identifier of a compartment defined in the enclosing Model object.
The "compartment" attribute can be used to indicate the compartment in
which the reaction is assumed to take place.  If the attribute is
present, its value must be the identifier of a Compartment object
defined in the enclosing Model object.  Similar to the "reversible"
attribute, the value of the "compartment" attribute has no direct impact
on the construction of mathematical equations for the SBML model.  When
a kinetic law is given for a reaction, the compartment location may
already be implicit in the kinetic law (although this cannot always be
guaranteed).  Nevertheless, software tools may find the "compartment"
attribute value useful for such purposes as analyzing the structure of
the model, guiding the modeler in constructing correct rate formulas,
and visualization purposes.
Readers are urged to read the SBML specification for more details about
the proper use of Reaction.

=head2 KineticLaw

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's KineticLaw construct.
An object of class KineticLaw is used to describe the rate at which the
process defined by a given Reaction takes place.  KineticLaw has
subelements called "math" (for MathML content) and "listOfParameters"
(of class ListOfParameters), in addition to the attributes and
subelements it inherits from SBase.
KineticLaw's "math" subelement for holding a MathML formula defines the
rate of the reaction.  The formula may refer to other entities in a
model as well as local parameter definitions within the scope of the
Reaction (see below).  It is important to keep in mind, however, that
the only Species identifiers that can be used in this formula are those
declared in the lists of reactants, products and modifiers in the
Reaction structure.  (In other words, before a species can be referenced
in the KineticLaw, it must be declared in one of those lists.)
KineticLaw provides a way to define I<local> parameters whose
identifiers can be used in the "math" formula of that KineticLaw
instance.  Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;3, these parameter definitions are
stored inside a "listOfParameters" subelement containing Parameter
objects; in SBML Level&nbsp;3, this is achieved using a specialized
object class called LocalParameter and the containing subelement is
called "listOfLocalParameters".  In both cases, the parameters so
defined are only visible within the KineticLaw; they cannot be accessed
outside.  A local parameter within one reaction is not visible from
within another reaction, nor is it visible to any other construct
outside of the KineticLaw in which it is defined.  In addition, another
important feature is that if such a Parameter (or in Level&nbsp;3,
LocalParameter) object has the same identifier as another object in the
scope of the enclosing Model, the definition inside the KineticLaw takes
precedence.  In other words, within the KineticLaw's "math" formula,
references to local parameter identifiers <strong>shadow any identical
global identifiers</strong>.
The values of local parameters defined within KineticLaw objects cannot
change.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, this quality is built into the
LocalParameter construct.  In Level&nbsp;2, where the same kind of
Parameter object class is used as for global parameters, the Parameter
objects' "constant" attribute must always have a value of C<true>
(either explicitly or left to its default value).
@section shadowing-warning A warning about identifier shadowing
A common misconception is that different classes of objects (e.g.,
species, compartments, parameters) in SBML have different identifier
scopes.  They do not.  The implication is that if a KineticLaw's local
parameter definition uses an identifier identical to I<any> other
identifier defined in the model outside the KineticLaw, even if the
other identifier does I<not> belong to a parameter type of object, the
local parameter's identifier takes precedence within that KineticLaw's
"math" formula.  It is not an error in SBML for identifiers to shadow
each other this way, but can lead to confusing and subtle errors.
@section version-diffs SBML Level/Version differences
In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1, the SBML specification
included two additional attributes on KineticLaw called "substanceUnits"
and "timeUnits".  They were removed beginning with SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;2 because further research determined they introduced many
problems.  The most significant problem was that their use could easily
lead to the creation of valid models whose reactions nevertheless could
not be integrated into a system of equations without outside knowledge
for converting the quantities used.  Examination of real-life models
revealed that a common reason for using "substanceUnits" on KineticLaw
was to set the units of all reactions to the same set of substance
units, something that is better achieved by using UnitDefinition to
redefine C<"substance"> for the whole Model.
As mentioned above, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions 2&ndash;4, local
parameters are of class Parameter.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the class of
object is LocalParameter.

=head2 SimpleSpeciesReference

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's SimpleSpeciesReference
construct.

As mentioned in the description of Reaction, every species that enters
into a given reaction must appear in that reaction's lists of reactants,
products and/or modifiers.  In an SBML model, all species that may
participate in any reaction are listed in the "listOfSpecies" element of
the top-level Model object.  Lists of products, reactants and modifiers
in Reaction objects do not introduce new species, but rather, they refer
back to those listed in the model's top-level "listOfSpecies".  For
reactants and products, the connection is made using SpeciesReference
objects; for modifiers, it is made using ModifierSpeciesReference
objects.  SimpleSpeciesReference is an abstract type that serves as the
parent class of both SpeciesReference and ModifierSpeciesReference.  It
is used simply to hold the attributes and elements that are common to
the latter two structures.
The SimpleSpeciesReference structure has a mandatory attribute,
"species", which must be a text string conforming to the identifer
syntax permitted in SBML.  This attribute is inherited by the
SpeciesReference and ModifierSpeciesReference subclasses derived from
SimpleSpeciesReference.  The value of the "species" attribute must be
the identifier of a species defined in the enclosing Model.  The species
is thereby declared as participating in the reaction being defined.  The
precise role of that species as a reactant, product, or modifier in the
reaction is determined by the subclass of SimpleSpeciesReference (i.e.,
either SpeciesReference or ModifierSpeciesReference) in which the
identifier appears.
SimpleSpeciesReference also contains an optional attribute, "id",
allowing instances to be referenced from other structures.  No SBML
structures currently do this; however, such structures are anticipated
in future SBML Levels.

=head2 SpeciesReference

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's SpeciesReference construct.
The Reaction structure provides a way to express which species act as
reactants and which species act as products in a reaction.  In a given
reaction, references to those species acting as reactants and/or
products are made using instances of SpeciesReference structures in a
Reaction object's lists of reactants and products.
A species can occur more than once in the lists of reactants and
products of a given Reaction instance.  The effective stoichiometry for
a species in a reaction is the sum of the stoichiometry values given on
the SpeciesReference object in the list of products minus the sum of
stoichiometry values given on the SpeciesReference objects in the list
of reactants.  A positive value indicates the species is effectively a
product and a negative value indicates the species is effectively a
reactant.  SBML places no restrictions on the effective stoichiometry of
a species in a reaction; for example, it can be zero.  In the following
SBML fragment, the two reactions have the same effective stoichiometry
for all their species:
@verbatim
<reaction id="x">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="a"/>
<speciesReference species="a"/>
<speciesReference species="b"/>
</listOfReactants>
<listOfProducts>
<speciesReference species="c"/>
<speciesReference species="b"/>
</listProducts>
</reaction>
<reaction id="y">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="a" stoichiometry="2"/>
</listOfReactants>
<listOfProducts>
<speciesReference species="c"/>
</listProducts>
</reaction>
@endverbatim

The precise structure of SpeciesReference differs between SBML
Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3.  We discuss the two variants in separate
sections below.
@section spr-l2 SpeciesReference in SBML Level 2
The mandatory "species" attribute of SpeciesReference must have as its
value the identifier of an existing species defined in the enclosing
Model.  The species is thereby designated as a reactant or product in
the reaction.  Which one it is (i.e., reactant or product) is indicated
by whether the SpeciesReference appears in the Reaction's "reactant" or
"product" lists.
Product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified using
<em>either</em> "stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" in a
SpeciesReference object.  The "stoichiometry" attribute is of type
double and should contain values greater than zero (0).  The
"stoichiometryMath" element is implemented as an element containing a
MathML expression.  These two are mutually exclusive; only one of
"stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" should be defined in a given
SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the attribute nor the element
is present, the value of "stoichiometry" in the SpeciesReference
instance defaults to C<1>.
For maximum interoperability, the "stoichiometry" attribute should be
used in preference to "stoichiometryMath" when a species' stoichiometry
is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).  When the stoichiometry
is a rational number, or when it is a more complicated formula,
"stoichiometryMath" must be used.  The MathML expression in
"stoichiometryMath" may also refer to identifiers of entities in a model
(except reaction identifiers).  However, the only species identifiers
that can be used in "stoichiometryMath" are those referenced in the
Reaction list of reactants, products and modifiers.
The following is a simple example of a species reference for species @c
X0, with stoichiometry C<2>, in a list of reactants within a reaction
having the identifier C<J1>:
@verbatim
<model>
...
<listOfReactions>
<reaction id="J1">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="X0" stoichiometry="2">
</listOfReactants>
...
</reaction>
...
</listOfReactions>
...
</model>
@endverbatim
The following is a more complex example of a species reference for
species X0, with a stoichiometry formula consisting of the parameter
C<x>:
@verbatim
<model>
...
<listOfReactions>
<reaction id="J1">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="X0">
<stoichiometryMath>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<ci>x</ci>
</math>
</stoichiometryMath>
</speciesReference>
</listOfReactants>
...
</reaction>
...
</listOfReactions>
...
</model>
@endverbatim
@section spr-l3 SpeciesReference in SBML Level 3
In Level 2's definition of a reaction, the stoichiometry attribute of a
SpeciesReference is actually a combination of two factors, the standard
biochemical stoichiometry and a conversion factor that may be needed to
translate the units of the species quantity to the units of the reaction
rate. Unfortunately, Level&nbsp;2 offers no direct way of decoupling
these two factors, or for explicitly indicating the units. The only way
to do it in Level&nbsp;2 is to use the StoichiometryMath object
associated with SpeciesReferences, and to reference SBML Parameter
objects from within the StoichiometryMath formula. This works because
Parameter offers a way to attach units to a numerical value, but the
solution is indirect and awkward for something that should be a simple
matter.  Moreover, the question of how to properly encode
stoichiometries in SBML reactions has caused much confusion among
implementors of SBML software.
SBML Level&nbsp;3 approaches this problem differently.  It (1) extends
the the use of the SpeciesReference identifier to represent the value of
the "stoichiometry" attribute, (2) makes the "stoichiometry" attribute
optional, (3) removes StoichiometryMath, and (4) adds a new "constant"
boolean attribute on SpeciesReference.
As in Level&nbsp;2, the "stoichiometry" attribute is of type
C<double> and should contain values greater than zero (C<0>).  A
missing "stoichiometry" implies that the stoichiometry is either
unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an
InitialAssignment object or other SBML construct elsewhere in the model.
A species reference's stoichiometry is set by its "stoichiometry"
attribute exactly once.  If the SpeciesReference object's "constant"
attribute has the value C<true>, then the stoichiometry is fixed and
cannot be changed except by an InitialAssignment object.  These two
methods of setting the stoichiometry (i.e., using "stoichiometry"
directly, or using InitialAssignment) differ in that the "stoichiometry"
attribute can only be set to a literal floating-point number, whereas
InitialAssignment allows the value to be set using an arbitrary
mathematical expression.  (As an example, the approach could be used to
set the stoichiometry to a rational number of the form I<p>/I<q>,
where I<p> and I<q> are integers, something that is occasionally
useful in the context of biochemical reaction networks.)  If the species
reference's "constant" attribute has the value C<false>, the species
reference's value may be overridden by an InitialAssignment or changed
by AssignmentRule or AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for simulation time
<em>t &gt; 0</em>, it may also be changed by a RateRule or Event
objects.  (However, some of these constructs are mutually exclusive; see
the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specifiation for more
details.)  It is not an error to define "stoichiometry" on a species
reference and also redefine the stoichiometry using an
InitialAssignment, but the "stoichiometry" attribute in that case is
ignored.

The value of the "id" attribute of a SpeciesReference can be used as the
content of a C<&lt;ci&gt;> element in MathML formulas
elsewhere in the model.  When the identifier appears in a MathML
C<&lt;ci&gt;> element, it represents the stoichiometry of the
corresponding species in the reaction where the SpeciesReference object
instance appears.  More specifically, it represents the value of the
"stoichiometry" attribute on the SpeciesReference object.
In SBML Level 3, the unit of measurement associated with the value of a
species' stoichiometry is always considered to be C<dimensionless>.
This has the following implications:
\n=over\n

\n=item\n\nWhen a species reference's identifier appears in mathematical
formulas elsewhere in the model, the unit associated with that value is
C<dimensionless>.
\n=item\n\nThe units of the "math" elements of AssignmentRule,
InitialAssignment and EventAssignment objects setting the stoichiometry
of the species reference should be C<dimensionless>.
\n=item\n\nIf a species reference's identifier is the subject of a RateRule,
the unit associated with the RateRule object's value should be
C<dimensionless>/<em>time</em>, where <em>time</em> is the
model-wide unit of time set on the Model object.

=item SpeciesReference::getDenominator

Get the value of the "denominator" attribute, for the case of a
rational-numbered stoichiometry or a model in SBML Level&nbsp;1.
The "denominator" attribute is only actually written out in the case
of an SBML Level&nbsp;1 model.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, rational-number
stoichiometries are written as MathML elements in the
"stoichiometryMath" subelement.  However, as a convenience to users,
libSBML allows the creation and manipulation of rational-number
stoichiometries by supplying the numerator and denominator directly
rather than having to manually create an ASTNode structure.  LibSBML
will write out the appropriate constructs (either a combination of
"stoichiometry" and "denominator" in the case of SBML Level&nbsp;1, or a
"stoichiometryMath" subelement in the case of SBML Level&nbsp;2).

In SBML Level 2, product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified
using <em>either</em> "stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" in a
SpeciesReference object.  The former is to be used when a
stoichiometry is simply a scalar number, while the latter is for
occasions when it needs to be a rational number or it needs to
reference other mathematical expressions.  The "stoichiometry"
attribute is of type C<double> and should contain values greater than
zero (C<0>).  The "stoichiometryMath" element is implemented as an
element containing a MathML expression.  These two are mutually
exclusive; only one of "stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" should
be defined in a given SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the
attribute nor the element is present, the value of "stoichiometry" in
the SpeciesReference instance defaults to C<1>.  For maximum
interoperability between different software tools, the "stoichiometry"
attribute should be used in preference to "stoichiometryMath" when a
species' stoichiometry is a simple scalar number (integer or
decimal).

In SBML Level 3, there is no StoichiometryMath, and SpeciesReference
objects have only the "stoichiometry" attribute.

=head2 ModifierSpeciesReference

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's ModifierSpeciesReference
construct.

Sometimes a species appears in the kinetic rate formula of a reaction
but is itself neither created nor destroyed in that reaction (for
example, because it acts as a catalyst or inhibitor).  In SBML, all such
species are simply called I<modifiers> without regard to the detailed
role of those species in the model.  The Reaction structure provides a
way to express which species act as modifiers in a given reaction.  This
is the purpose of the list of modifiers available in Reaction.  The list
contains instances of ModifierSpeciesReference structures.
The ModifierSpeciesReference structure inherits the mandatory attribute
"species" and optional attributes "id" and "name" from the parent class
SimpleSpeciesReference.  See the description of SimpleSpeciesReference
for more information about these.
The value of the "species" attribute must be the identifier of a species
defined in the enclosing Model; this species is designated as a modifier
for the current reaction.  A reaction may have any number of modifiers.
It is permissible for a modifier species to appear simultaneously in the
list of reactants and products of the same reaction where it is
designated as a modifier, as well as to appear in the list of reactants,
products and modifiers of other reactions in the model.

=head2 Event

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Event construct.
An SBML Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables
that are affected by it, how the variables are affected, and the event's
relationship to other events.  The effect of the event can optionally be
delayed after the occurrence of the condition which invokes it.
The operation of Event is divided into two phases (even when the event
is not delayed): one when the event is I<triggered>, and the other when
the event is I<executed>.  Trigger objects define the conditions for
triggering an event, Delay objects define when the event is actually
executed, EventAssignment objects define the effects of executing the
event, and (in SBML Level&nbsp;3) Priority objects influence the order
of EventAssignment performance in cases of simultaneous events.  Please
consult the descriptions of Trigger, Delay, EventAssignment and Priority
for more information.
@section version-diffs SBML Level/Version differences
@subsection sbml-l3 SBML Level 3
SBML Level 3 introduces several changes to the structure and components
of Events compared to SBML Level&nbsp;2.  These changes fall into two
main categories: changes to what is optional or required, and additions
of new attributes and elements.
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\nThe attribute "useValuesFromTriggerTime" on Event is mandatory (it
was optional in Level&nbsp;2);
\n=item\n\nEvent's "listOfEventAssignments" element (of class
ListOfEventAssignments) is optional (it was mandatory in Level&nbsp;2);
\n=item\n\nEvent's "priority" element (of class Priority) is new in
Level&nbsp;3; and
\n=item\n\nThe Trigger object gains new mandatory attributes (described as part
of the definition of Trigger).
\n=back\n

The changes to the attributes of Event are described below; the changes
to Trigger and Priority are described in their respective sections.
@subsection sbml-l2 SBML Level 2
In SBML Level&nbsp;2 versions before Version&nbsp;4, the semantics of
Event time delays were defined such that the expressions in the event's
assignments were always evaluated at the time the event was
<em>triggered</em>.  This definition made it difficult to define an event
whose assignment formulas were meant to be evaluated at the time the
event was <em>executed</em> (i.e., after the time period defined by the
value of the Delay element).  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in
Level&nbsp;3, the attribute "useValuesFromTriggerTime" on Event allows a
model to indicate the time at which the event's assignments are intended
the values of the assignment formulas are computed at the moment the
event is triggered, not after the delay.  If "useValuesFromTriggerTime"=@c
false, it means that the formulas in the event's assignments are to be
computed I<after> the delay, at the time the event is executed.
The definition of Event in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions 1 and 2 includes
an additional attribute called "timeUnits", which allowed the time units
of the Delay to be set explicitly.  Later Versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2
as well as SBML Level&nbsp;3 do not define this attribute.  LibSBML
supports this attribute for compatibility with previous versions of SBML
Level&nbsp;2; however, if a model in SBML Level&nbsp;3 or Level&nbsp;2
Versions&nbsp;3&ndash;4 format sets the attribute, the
consistency-checking method SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() will report
an error.
The attribute "useValuesFromTriggerTime" was introduced in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4.  Models defined in prior Versions of SBML
Level&nbsp;2 cannot use this attribute, and
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() will report an error if they do.
@section semantics Semantics of events in SBML Level 3 Version&nbsp;1
The detailed semantics of events are described in the specification
documents for each SBML Level/Version.  Here we include the description
from the SBML Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;1.
Any transition of a Trigger object's "math" formula from the value @c
false to C<true> will cause the enclosing Event object to
<em>trigger</em>.  Such a transition is not possible at the very start
of a simulation (i.e., at time <em>t = 0</em>) unless the Trigger
object's "initialValue" attribute has a value of C<false>; this defines
the value of the trigger formula to be C<false> immediately prior to the
start of simulation, thereby giving it the potential to change in value
from C<false> to C<true> when the formula is evaluated at <em>t =
0</em>.  If "initialValue"=C<true>, then the trigger expression cannot
transition from C<false> to C<true> at <em>t = 0</em> but may do so at
some time <em>t E<gt> 0</em>.
Consider an Event object definition <EM>E</EM> with delay <em>d</em> in
which the Trigger object's "math" formula makes a transition in value
from C<false> to C<true> at times <em>t<sub>1</sub></em> and
<em>t<sub>2</sub></em>.  The EventAssignment within the Event object
will have effect at <em>t<sub>1</sub> + d</em> and
<em>t<sub>2</sub> + d</em> irrespective of the relative times of
<em>t<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>t<sub>2</sub></em>.  For example, events
can "overlap" so that <em>t<sub>1</sub> E<lt> t<sub>2</sub> <
t<sub>1</sub> + d</em> still causes an event assignments to occur at
<em>t<sub>1</sub> + d</em> and <em>t<sub>2</sub> + d</em>.
It is entirely possible for two events to be executed simultaneously,
and it is possible for events to trigger other events (i.e., an event
assignment can cause an event to trigger).  This leads to several
points:
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\nA software package should retest all event triggers after executing
an event assignment in order to account for the possibility that the
assignment causes another event trigger to transition from C<false> to
C<true>.  This check should be made after each individual Event object's
execution, even when several events are to be executed simultaneously.
\n=item\n\nAny Event object whose Trigger "persistent" attribute has the value
C<false> must have its trigger expression reevaluated continuously
between when the event is triggered and when it is executed.  If
its trigger expression ever evaluates to C<false>, it must be removed
from the queue of events pending execution and treated as any other
event whose trigger expression evaluates to C<false>.
\n=item\n\nAlthough the precise time at which events are executed is not
resolved beyond the given execution point in simulated time, it is
assumed that the order in which the events occur <em>is</em> resolved.
This order can be significant in determining the overall outcome of a
given simulation.  When an event <EM>X</EM> <em>triggers</em> another
event <EM>Y</EM> and event <EM>Y</EM> has zero delay, then event
<EM>Y</EM> is added to the existing set of simultaneous events that are
pending <em>execution</em>.  Events <EM>X</EM> and <EM>Y</EM> form a
cascade of events at the same point in simulation time.  An event such
as <EM>Y</EM> may have a special priority if it contains a Priority
subobject.

\n=item\n\nAll events in a model are open to being in a cascade.  The position
of an event in the event queue does not affect whether it can be in the
cascade: event <EM>Y</EM> can be triggered whether it is before or after
<EM>X</EM> in the queue of events pending execution.  A cascade of
events can be potentially infinite (never terminate); when this occurs a
simulator should indicate this has occurred&mdash;it is incorrect for a
simulator to break a cascade arbitrarily and continue the simulation
without at least indicating that the infinite cascade occurred.
\n=item\n\nSimultaneous events having no defined priorities are executed in an
undefined order.  This does not mean that the behavior of the simulation
is completely undefined; merely that the <em>order</em> of execution of
these particular events is undefined.  A given simulator may use any
algorithm to choose an order as long as every event is executed exactly
once.

\n=item\n\nEvents with defined priorities are executed in the order implied by
their Priority "math" formula values, with events having higher
priorities being executed ahead of events with lower priorities, and
events with identical priorities being executed in a random order with
respect to one another (as determined at run-time by some random
algorithm equivalent to coin-flipping).  Newly-triggered events that are
to be executed immediately (i.e., if they define no delays) should be
inserted into the queue of events pending execution according to their
priorities: events with higher priority values value must be inserted
ahead of events with lower priority values and after any pending events
with even higher priorities, and inserted randomly among pending events
with the same priority values.  Events without Priority objects must be
inserted into the queue in some fashion, but the algorithm used to place
it in the queue is undefined.  Similarly, there is no restriction on the
order of a newly-inserted event with a defined Priority with respect to
any other pending Event without a defined Priority.
\n=item\n\nA model variable that is the target of one or more event
assignments can change more than once when simultaneous events are
processed at some time point <em>t</em>.  The model's behavior (output)
for such a variable is the value of the variable at the end of
processing all the simultaneous events at time <em>t</em>.

=head2 EventAssignment

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's EventAssignment construct for
Event.

Event contains an optional element called "listOfEventAssignments", of
class ListOfEventAssignments.  In every instance of an event definition
in a model, the object's "listOfEventAssignments" element must have a
non-empty list of one or more "eventAssignment" elements of class
EventAssignment.  The object class EventAssignment has one required
attribute, "variable", and a required element, "math".  Being derived
from SBase, it also has all the usual attributes and elements of its
parent class.
An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are
affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The purpose
of the EventAssignment object class is to define how variables are
affected by an Event.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, every Event object instance
must have a nonempty list of event assignments; in SBML Level&nbsp;3,
the list of assignments is optional.
The operation of an Event is divided into two phases (regardless of
whether a delay is involved): one phase when the event is I<triggered>,
and the other when the event is I<executed>.   EventAssignment objects
are interpreted when an event is executed.  The effects are described
below.

@section event-variable The attribute "variable"
The EventAssignment attribute "variable" must be the identifier of an
existing Compartment, Species, SpeciesReference, or Parameter
instance defined in the model.  When the event is executed, the value of
the model component identified by "variable" is changed by the
EventAssignment to the value computed by the "math" element; that is, a
species' quantity, species reference's stoichiometry, compartment's size
or parameter's value are reset to the value computed by "math".
Certain restrictions are placed on what can appear in "variable":
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\nThe object identified by the value of the EventAssignment attribute
"variable" must not have its "constant" attribute set to or default to
C<true>.  (Constants cannot be affected by events.)
\n=item\n\nThe "variable" attribute must not contain the identifier of a
reaction; only species, species references, compartment and parameter
values may be set by an Event.
\n=item\n\nThe value of every "variable" attribute must be unique among the set
of EventAssignment structures within a given Event structure.  In other
words, a single event cannot have multiple EventAssignment objects
assigning the same variable.  (All of them would be performed at the
same time when that particular Event triggers, resulting in
indeterminacy.)  However, I<separate> Event instances can refer to the
same variable.
\n=item\n\nA variable cannot be assigned a value in an EventAssignment object
instance and also be assigned a value by an AssignmentRule; i.e., the
value of an EventAssignment's "variable" attribute cannot be the same as
the value of a AssignmentRule' "variable" attribute.  (Assignment rules
hold at all times, therefore it would be inconsistent to also define an
event that reassigns the value of the same variable.)
\n=back\n

Note that the time of assignment of the object identified by the
value of the "variable" attribute is always the time at which the Event
is <em>executed</em>, not when it is <em>triggered</em>.  The timing is
controlled by the optional Delay in an Event.  The time of
assignment is not affected by the "useValuesFromTriggerTime"
attribute on Event&mdash;that attribute affects the time at which the
EventAssignment's "math" expression is I<evaluated>.  In other
words, SBML allows decoupling the time at which the
"variable" is assigned from the time at which its value
expression is calculated.
@section event-math The "math" subelement in an EventAssignment
The MathML expression contained in an EventAssignment defines the new
value of the variable being assigned by the Event.
As mentioned above, the time at which the expression in "math" is
evaluated is determined by the attribute "useValuesFromTriggerTime" on
Event.  If the attribute value is C<true>, the expression must be
evaluated when the event is I<triggered>; more precisely, the values of
identifiers occurring in MathML C<&lt;ci&gt;> elements in the
EventAssignment's "math" expression are the values they have at the
point when the event I<triggered>.  If, instead,
"useValuesFromTriggerTime"'s value is C<false>, it means the values at
I<execution> time should be used; that is, the values of identifiers
occurring in MathML C<&lt;ci&gt;> elements in the
EventAssignment's "math" expression are the values they have at the
point when the event I<executed>.
@section version-diffs SBML Level/Version differences
Between Version&nbsp;4 and previous versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2, the
requirements regarding the matching of units between an
EvengAssignment's formula and the units of the object identified by the
"variable" attribute changed.  Previous versions required consistency,
but in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3, unit
consistency is only I<recommended>.  More precisely:
\n=over\n

\n=item\n\nIn the case of a species, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
species' quantity (concentration or amount of substance) to the value
determined by the formula in the EventAssignment's "math" subelement.
The units of the "math" formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;4 and in Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions of
Level&nbsp;2) be identical to the units of the species.
\n=item\n\n(SBML Level&nbsp;3 only.) In the case of a species reference, an
EventAssignment sets the stoichiometry of the reactant or product
referenced by the SpeciesReference object to the value determined by the
formula in the "math" element.  The unit associated with the value
produced by the "math" formula should be C<dimensionless>, because
reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless
quantities.

\n=item\n\nIn the case of a compartment, an EventAssignment sets the
referenced compartment's size to the size determined by the formula in
the "math" subelement of the EventAssignment.  The overall units of the
formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in Level&nbsp;3)
or must (in previous Versions of Level&nbsp;2) be identical to the units
specified for the size of the compartment identified by the
EventAssignment's "variable" attribute.
\n=item\n\nIn the case of a parameter, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
parameter's value to that determined by the formula in "math".  The
overall units of the formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4
and Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions of Level&nbsp;2) be
identical to the units defined for the parameter.
\n=back\n

Note that the formula placed in the "math" element <em>has no assumed
units</em>.  The consistency of the units of the formula, and the units
of the entity which the assignment affects, must be explicitly
established just as in the case of the value of the Delay subelement.
An approach similar to the one discussed in the context of Delay may be
used for the formula of an EventAssignment.

=head2 Trigger

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Trigger construct for Event.
An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are
affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The Trigger
construct in SBML is used to define a mathematical expression that
determines when an Event is I<triggered>.
A Trigger object in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 contains one
subelement named "math" containing a MathML expression.  The expression
must evaluate to a value of type C<boolean>.  The exact moment at which
the expression evaluates to C<true> is the time point when the Event is
I<triggered>.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, Trigger has additional attributes
that must be assigned values; they are discussed in a separate section
below.

An event only I<triggers> when its Trigger expression makes the
transition in value from C<false> to C<true>.  The event will also
trigger at any subsequent time points when the trigger makes this
transition; in other words, an event can be triggered multiple times
during a simulation if its trigger condition makes the transition from
C<false> to C<true> more than once.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the behavior
at the very start of simulation (i.e., at <em>t = 0</em>, where
<em>t</em> stands for time) is determined in part by the boolean flag
"initialValue".  This and other additional features introduced in SBML
Level&nbsp;3 are discussed further below.
@section version-diffs Version differences
SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 introduces two required attributes
on the Trigger object: "persistent" and "initialValue".  The rest of
this introduction describes these two attributes.
@subsection trigger-persistent The "persistent" attribute on Trigger
In the interval between when an Event object <em>triggers</em> (i.e.,
its Trigger object expression transitions in value from C<false> to
C<true>) and when its assignments are to be <em>executed</em>, conditions
in the model may change such that the trigger expression transitions
back from C<true> to C<false>.  Should the event's assignments still be
made if this happens?  Answering this question is the purpose of the
"persistent" attribute on Trigger.
If the boolean attribute "persistent" has a value of C<true>, then once
the event is triggered, all of its assignments are always performed when
the time of execution is reached.  The name I<persistent> is meant to
evoke the idea that the trigger expression does not have to be
re-checked after it triggers if "persistent"=C<true>.  Conversely, if
the attribute value is C<false>, then the trigger expression is not
assumed to persist: if the expression transitions in value back to @c
false at any time between when the event triggered and when it is to be
executed, the event is no longer considered to have triggered and its
assignments are not executed.  (If the trigger expression transitions
once more to C<true> after that point, then the event is triggered, but
this then constitutes a whole new event trigger-and-execute sequence.)
The "persistent" attribute can be especially useful when Event objects
contain Delay objects, but it is relevant even in a model without delays
if the model contains two or more events.  As explained in the
introduction to this section, the operation of all events in SBML
(delayed or not) is conceptually divided into two phases,
<em>triggering</em> and <em>execution</em>; however, unless events have
priorities associated with them, SBML does not mandate a particular
ordering of event execution in the case of simultaneous events.  Models
with multiple events can lead to situations where the execution of one
event affects another event's trigger expression value.  If that other
event has "persistent"=C<false>, and its trigger expression evaluates to
C<false> before it is to be executed, the event must not be executed
after all.
@subsection trigger-initialvalue The "initialValue" attribute on Trigger
As mentioned above, an event <em>triggers</em> when the mathematical
expression in its Trigger object transitions in value from C<false> to
C<true>.  An unanswered question concerns what happens at the start of a
simulation: can event triggers make this transition at <em>t = 0</em>,
where <em>t</em> stands for time?
In order to determine whether an event may trigger at <em>t = 0</em>, it
is necessary to know what value the Trigger object's "math" expression
had immediately prior to <em>t = 0</em>.  This starting value of the
trigger expression is determined by the value of the boolean attribute
"initialValue".  A value of C<true> means the trigger expression is
taken to have the value C<true> immediately prior to <em>t = 0</em>.  In
that case, the trigger cannot transition in value from C<false> to @c
true at the moment simulation begins (because it has the value C<true>
both before and after <em>t = 0</em>), and can only make the transition
from C<false> to C<true> sometime <em>after</em> <em>t = 0</em>.  (To do
that, it would also first have to transition to C<false> before it could
make the transition from C<false> back to C<true>.)  Conversely, if
"initialValue"=C<false>, then the trigger expression is assumed to start
with the value C<false>, and therefore may trigger at <em>t = 0</em> if
the expression evaluates to C<true> at that moment.

=head2 Delay

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML's Delay construct for Event.
An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
effect of the event can optionally be delayed after the occurrence of
the condition which invokes it.  An event delay is defined using an
object of class Delay.
The object class Delay is derived from SBase and adds a single
subelement called "math".  This subelement is used to hold MathML
content.  The mathematical formula represented by "math" must evaluate
to a numerical value.  It is used as the length of time between when the
event is I<triggered> and when the event's assignments are
actually I<executed>.  If no delay is present on a given Event, a time
delay of zero is assumed.
The expression in "math" must be evaluated at the time the event is @em
triggered.  The expression must always evaluate to a nonnegative number
(otherwise, a nonsensical situation could arise where an event is
defined to execute before it is triggered!).
@section delay-units The units of the mathematical expression in a Delay
In SBML Level&nbsp;2 versions before Version&nbsp;4, the units of the
numerical value computed by the Delay's "math" expression are @em
required to be in units of time, or the model is considered to have a
unit consistency error.  In Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 as well as SBML
Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core, this requirement is relaxed; these
specifications only stipulate that the units of the numerical value
computed by a Delay instance's "math" expression I<should> match the
model's units of time (meaning the definition of the C<time> units in
the model).  LibSBML respects these requirements, and depending on
whether an earlier Version of SBML Level&nbsp;2 is in use, libSBML may
or may not flag unit inconsistencies as errors or merely warnings.
Note that <em>units are not predefined or assumed</em> for the contents
of "math" in a Delay object; rather, they must be defined explicitly for
each instance of a Delay object in a model.  This is an important point
to bear in mind when literal numbers are used in delay expressions.  For
example, the following Event instance would result in a warning logged
by SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() about the fact that libSBML cannot
verify the consistency of the units of the expression.  The reason is
that the formula inside the "math" element does not have any declared
units, whereas what is expected in this context is units of time:
@verbatim
<model>
...
<listOfEvents>
<event useValuesFromTriggerTime="true">
...
<delay>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<cn> 1 </cn>
</math>
</delay>
...
</event>
</listOfEvents>
...
</model>
@endverbatim
The C<&lt;cn&gt; 1 &lt;/cn&gt;> within the mathematical formula
of the C<delay> above has <em>no units declared</em>.  To make the
expression have the needed units of time, literal numbers should be
avoided in favor of defining Parameter objects for each quantity, and
declaring units for the Parameter values.  The following fragment of
SBML illustrates this approach:
@verbatim
<model>
...
<listOfParameters>
<parameter id="transcriptionDelay" value="10" units="second"/>
</listOfParameters>
...
<listOfEvents>
<event useValuesFromTriggerTime="true">
...
<delay>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<ci> transcriptionDelay </ci>
</math>
</delay>
...
</event>
</listOfEvents>
...
</model>
@endverbatim
In SBML Level&nbsp;3, an alternative approach is available in the form
of the C<units> attribute, which SBML Level&nbsp;3 allows to appear on
MathML C<cn> elements.  The value of this attribute can be used to
indicate the unit of measurement to be associated with the number in the
content of a C<cn> element.  The attribute is named C<units> but,
because it appears inside MathML element (which is in the XML namespace
for MathML and not the namespace for SBML), it must always be prefixed
with an XML namespace prefix for the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1
namespace.  The following is an example of this approach:
@verbatim
<model timeUnits="second" ...>
...
<listOfEvents>
<event useValuesFromTriggerTime="true">
...
<delay>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
xmlns:sbml="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core">
<cn sbml:units="second"> 10 </cn>
</math>
</delay>
...
</event>
</listOfEvents>
...
</model>

=head2 Priority

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML Level 3's Priority construct for
Event.

The Priority object class (which was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3
Version&nbsp;1), like Delay, is derived from SBase and contains a MathML
formula stored in the element "math".  This formula is used to compute a
dimensionless numerical value that influences the order in which a
simulator is to perform the assignments of two or more events that
happen to be executed simultaneously.  The formula may evaluate to any
C<double> value (and thus may be a positive or negative number, or
zero), with positive numbers taken to signifying a higher priority than
zero or negative numbers.  If no Priority object is present on a given
Event object, no priority is defined for that event.
@section priority-interp The interpretation of priorities on events in a model
For the purposes of SBML, <em>simultaneous event execution</em> is
defined as the situation in which multiple events have identical
times of execution.  The time of execution is calculated as the
sum of the time at which a given event's Trigger is <em>triggered</em>
plus its Delay duration, if any.  Here, <em>identical times</em> means
<em>mathematically equal</em> instants in time.  (In practice,
simulation software adhering to this specification may have to
rely on numerical equality instead of strict mathematical
equality; robust models will ensure that this difference will not
cause significant discrepancies from expected behavior.)
If no Priority subobjects are defined for two or more Event objects,
then those events are still executed simultaneously but their order of
execution is <em>undefined by the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1
specification</em>.  A software implementation may choose to execute
such simultaneous events in any order, as long as each event is executed
only once and the requirements of checking the "persistent" attribute
(and acting accordingly) are satisfied.
If Priority subobjects are defined for two or more
simultaneously-triggered events, the order in which those particular
events must be executed is dictated by their Priority objects,
as follows.  If the values calculated using the two Priority
objects' "math" expressions differ, then the event having
the higher priority value must be executed before the event with
the lower value.  If, instead, the two priority values are
mathematically equal, then the two events must be triggered in a
<em>random</em> order.  It is important to note that a <em>random
order is not the same as an undefined order</em>: given multiple
runs of the same model with identical conditions, an undefined
ordering would permit a system to execute the events in (for
example) the same order every time (according to whatever scheme
may have been implemented by the system), whereas the explicit
requirement for random ordering means that the order of execution
in different simulation runs depends on random chance.  In other
words, given two events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, a randomly-determined
order must lead to an equal chance of executing <em>A</em> first or
<em>B</em> first, every time those two events are executed
simultaneously.

A model may contain a mixture of events, some of which have
Priority subobjects and some do not.  Should a combination of
simultaneous events arise in which some events have priorities
defined and others do not, the set of events with defined
priorities must trigger in the order determined by their Priority
objects, and the set of events without Priority objects must be
executed in an <em>undefined</em> order with respect to each other
and with respect to the events with Priority subobjects.  (Note
that <em>undefined order</em> does not necessarily mean random
order, although a random ordering would be a valid implementation
of this requirement.)
The following example may help further clarify these points.
Suppose a model contains four events that should be executed
simultaneously, with two of the events having Priority objects
with the same value and the other two events having Priority
objects with the same, but different, value.  The two events with
the higher priorities must be executed first, in a random order
with respect to each other, and the remaining two events must be
executed after them, again in a random order, for a total of four
possible and equally-likely event executions: A-B-C-D, A-B-D-C,
B-A-C-D, and B-A-D-C.  If, instead, the model contains four events
all having the same Priority values, there are 4! or 24
possible orderings, each of which must be equally likely to be
chosen.  Finally, if none of the four events has a Priority
subobject defined, or even if exactly one of the four events has a
defined Priority, there are again 24 possible orderings, but the
likelihood of choosing any particular ordering is undefined; the
simulator can choose between events as it wishes.  (The SBML
specification only defines the effects of priorities on Event
objects with respect to <em>other</em> Event objects with
priorities.  Putting a priority on a <em>single</em> Event object
in a model does not cause it to fall within that scope.)
@section priority-eval Evaluation of Priority expressions
An event's Priority object "math" expression must be
evaluated at the time the Event is to be <em>executed</em>.  During
a simulation, all simultaneous events have their Priority values
calculated, and the event with the highest priority is selected for
next execution.  Note that it is possible for the execution of one
Event object to cause the Priority value of another
simultaneously-executing Event object to change (as well as to
trigger other events, as already noted).  Thus, after executing
one event, and checking whether any other events in the model have
been triggered, all remaining simultaneous events that
<em>either</em> (i) have Trigger objects with attributes
"persistent"=C<false> <em>or</em> (ii) have Trigger
expressions that did not transition from C<true> to
C<false>, must have their Priority expression reevaluated.
The highest-priority remaining event must then be selected for 
execution next.
@section priority-units Units of Priority object's mathematical expressions
The unit associated with the value of a Priority object's
"math" expression should be C<dimensionless>.  This is
because the priority expression only serves to provide a relative
ordering between different events, and only has meaning with
respect to other Priority object expressions.  The value of
Priority objects is not comparable to any other kind of object in
an SBML model.
@note The Priority construct exists only in SBML Level&nbsp;3; it cannot
be used in SBML Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;1 models.

The values of "id" attributes on SBML components allow the components to
be cross-referenced within a model. The values of "name" attributes on
SBML components provide the opportunity to assign them meaningful labels
suitable for display to humans.  The specific identifiers and labels
used in a model necessarily must be unrestricted by SBML, so that
software and users are free to pick whatever they need.  However, this
freedom makes it more difficult for software tools to determine, without
additional human intervention, the semantics of models more precisely
than the semantics provided by the SBML object classes defined in other
sections of this document.  For example, there is nothing inherent in a
parameter with identifier C<k> that would indicate to a
software tool it is a first-order rate constant (if that's what
C<k> happened to be in some given model).  However, one may
need to convert a model between different representations (e.g.,
Henri-Michaelis-Menten versus elementary steps), or to use it with
different modeling approaches (discrete or continuous).  One may also
need to relate the model components with other description formats such
as SBGN (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.sbgn.org/">http://www.sbgn.org/</a>) using deeper
semantics.  Although an advanced software tool <em>might</em> be able to
deduce the semantics of some model components through detailed analysis
of the kinetic rate expressions and other parts of the model, this
quickly becomes infeasible for any but the simplest of models.
An approach to solving this problem is to associate model components
with terms from carefully curated controlled vocabularies (CVs).  This
is the purpose of the optional "sboTerm" attribute provided on the SBML
class SBase.  The "sboTerm" attribute always refers to terms belonging
to the Systems Biology Ontology (SBO).
@section use Use of SBO
Labeling model components with terms from shared controlled vocabularies
allows a software tool to identify each component using identifiers that
are not tool-specific.  An example of where this is useful is the desire
by many software developers to provide users with meaningful names for
reaction rate equations.  Software tools with editing interfaces
frequently provide these names in menus or lists of choices for users.
However, without a standardized set of names or identifiers shared
between developers, a given software package cannot reliably interpret
the names or identifiers of reactions used in models written by other
tools.

The first solution that might come to mind is to stipulate that certain
common reactions always have the same name (e.g., "Michaelis-Menten"), but
this is simply impossible to do: not only do humans often disagree on
the names themselves, but it would not allow for correction of errors or
updates to the list of predefined names except by issuing new releases
of the SBML specification&mdash;to say nothing of many other limitations
with this approach.  Moreover, the parameters and variables that appear
in rate expressions also need to be identified in a way that software
tools can interpret mechanically, implying that the names of these
entities would also need to be regulated.
The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) provides terms for identifying most
elements of SBML. The relationship implied by an "sboTerm" on an SBML
model component is <em>is-a</em> between the characteristic of the
component meant to be described by SBO on this element and the SBO
term identified by the value of the "sboTerm". By adding SBO term
references on the components of a model, a software tool can provide
additional details using independent, shared vocabularies that can
enable <em>other</em> software tools to recognize precisely what the
component is meant to be.  Those tools can then act on that information.
For example, if the SBO identifier C<"SBO>:0000049" is assigned
to the concept of "first-order irreversible mass-action kinetics,
continuous framework", and a given KineticLaw object in a model has an
"sboTerm" attribute with this value, then regardless of the identifier
and name given to the reaction itself, a software tool could use this to
inform users that the reaction is a first-order irreversible mass-action
reaction.  This kind of reverse engineering of the meaning of reactions
in a model would be difficult to do otherwise, especially for more
complex reaction types.
The presence of SBO labels on Compartment, Species, and Reaction
objects in SBML can help map those entities to equivalent concepts in
other standards, such as (but not limited to) BioPAX (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.biopax.org/">http://www.biopax.org/</a>), PSI-MI (<a
target="_blank"
href="http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/60">http://www.psidev.info</a>),
or the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN, <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.sbgn.org/">http://www.sbgn.org/</a>).  Such mappings
can be used in conversion procedures, or to build interfaces, with SBO
becoming a kind of "glue" between standards of representation.
The presence of the label on a kinetic expression can also allow
software tools to make more intelligent decisions about reaction rate
expressions.  For example, an application could recognize certain types
of reaction formulas as being ones it knows how to solve with optimized
procedures.  The application could then use internal, optimized code
implementing the rate formula indexed by identifiers such as
C<"SBO>:0000049" appearing in SBML models.
Finally, SBO labels may be very valuable when it comes to model
integration, by helping identify interfaces, convert mathematical
expressions and parameters etc.
Although the use of SBO can be beneficial, it is critical to keep in
mind that the presence of an "sboTerm" value on an object <em>must not
change the fundamental mathematical meaning</em> of the model.  An SBML
model must be defined such that it stands on its own and does not depend
on additional information added by SBO terms for a correct mathematical
interpretation.  SBO term definitions will not imply any alternative
mathematical semantics for any SBML object labeled with that term.  Two
important reasons motivate this principle.  First, it would be too
limiting to require all software tools to be able to understand the SBO
vocabularies in addition to understanding SBML.  Supporting SBO is not
only additional work for the software developer; for some kinds of
applications, it may not make sense.  If SBO terms on a model are
optional, it follows that the SBML model <em>must</em> remain
unambiguous and fully interpretable without them, because an application
reading the model may ignore the terms.  Second, we believe allowing the
use of "sboTerm" to alter the mathematical meaning of a model would
allow too much leeway to shoehorn inconsistent concepts into SBML
objects, ultimately reducing the interoperability of the models.
@section relationship Relationships between SBO and SBML
The goal of SBO labeling for SBML is to clarify to the fullest extent
possible the nature of each element in a model.  The approach taken in
SBO begins with a hierarchically-structured set of controlled
vocabularies with six main divisions: (1) entity, (2) participant role,
(3) quantitative parameter, (4) modeling framework, (5) mathematical
expression, and (6) interaction.  The web site for SBO (<a
target="_blank"
href="http://biomodels.net/sbo">http://biomodels.net</a>) should be
consulted for the current version of the ontology.
The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) is not part of SBML; it is being
developed separately, to allow the modeling community to evolve the
ontology independently of SBML.  However, the terms in the ontology are
being designed keeping SBML components in mind, and are classified into
subsets that can be directly related with SBML components such as
reaction rate expressions, parameters, and others.  The use of "sboTerm"
attributes is optional, and the presence of "sboTerm" on an element does
not change the way the model is <em>interpreted</em>.  Annotating SBML
elements with SBO terms adds additional semantic information that may
be used to <em>convert</em> the model into another model, or another
format.  Although SBO support provides an important source of
information to understand the meaning of a model, software does not need
to support "sboTerm" to be considered SBML-compliant.

Returns C<true> or C<false> depending on whether the C<uri> argument string
conforms to the XML data type C<anyURI>.
Type anyURI is defined by XML Schema 1.0. It is a character string 
data type whose values are interpretable as URIs (Universal Resource 
Identifiers) as described by the W3C document RFC 3986.  LibSBML
does not provide an explicit XML C<anyURI> data type; it uses
ordinary character strings, which is easier for applications to
support.  LibSBML does, however, test for anyURI validity at
various times, such as when reading in models from files and data
streams.

This method provides programs with the ability to test explicitly that
the strings they create conform to the XML anyURI syntax.
@param uri string to be checked for conformance to the syntax of
<a target="_blank"

In SBML, the identifiers of units (of both the predefined units and

=item SyntaxChecker::hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax

Returns C<true> or C<false> depending on whether the given XMLNode
object contains valid XHTML content.
C<opydetails> doc_what_are_notes
An aspect of XHTML validity is that the content is declared to be in
the XML namespace for XHTML&nbsp;1.0.  There is more than one way in
which this can be done in XML.  In particular, a model might not
contain the declaration within the "notes" or "message" subelement
itself, but might instead place the declaration on an enclosing
element and use an XML namespace prefix within the "notes" element to
refer to it.  In other words, the following is valid:
@verbatim
<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3" level="2" version="3"
xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<model>
<notes>
<xhtml:body>
<xhtml:center><xhtml:h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</xhtml:h2></xhtml:center>
<xhtml:p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator.</xhtml:p>
</xhtml:body>
</notes>
... rest of model ...
</sbml>
@endverbatim
Contrast the above with the following, self-contained version, which
places the XML namespace declaration within the C<&lt;notes&gt;>
element itself:
@verbatim
<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3" level="2" version="3">
<model>
<notes>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<body>
<center><h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</h2></center>
<p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator.</p>
</body>
</html>
</notes>
... rest of model ...
</sbml>
@endverbatim
Both of the above are valid XML.  The purpose of the C<sbmlns>
argument to this method is to allow callers to check the validity of
"notes" and "message" subelements whose XML namespace declarations
have been put elsewhere in the manner illustrated above.  Callers can
can pass in the SBMLNamespaces object of a higher-level model
component if the XMLNode object does not itself have the XML namespace
declaration for XHTML&nbsp;1.0.
@param xhtml the XMLNode to be checked for conformance.
@param sbmlns the SBMLNamespaces associated with the object.

=head2 StoichiometryMath

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;2's StoichiometryMath
construct.

@section l2-stoichiometries Stoichiometries in SBML Level 2
In SBML Level 2, product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified
using I<either> the "stoichiometry" attribute or a "stoichiometryMath"
element in a SpeciesReference object.  The "stoichiometry" attribute is
of type C<double> and should contain values greater than zero (0).  The
"stoichiometryMath" element is implemented as an element containing a
MathML expression.  These two are mutually exclusive; only one of
"stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" should be defined in a given
SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the attribute nor the element
is present, the value of "stoichiometry" in the enclosing
SpeciesReference instance defaults to C<1>.
For maximum interoperability, SpeciesReference's "stoichiometry"
attribute should be used in preference to "stoichiometryMath" when a
species' stoichiometry is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).
When the stoichiometry is a rational number, or when it is a more
complicated formula, "stoichiometryMath" must be used.  The MathML
expression in "stoichiometryMath" may also refer to identifiers of
entities in a model (except reaction identifiers).  However, the only
species identifiers that can be used in "stoichiometryMath" are those
referenced in the enclosing Reaction's list of reactants, products and
modifiers.

The "stoichiometry" attribute and the "stoichiometryMath" element, when
either is used, is each interpreted as a factor applied to the reaction
rate to produce the rate of change of the species identified by the
"species" attribute in the enclosing SpeciesReference.  This is the
normal interpretation of a stoichiometry, but in SBML, one additional
consideration has to be taken into account.  The reaction rate, which is
the result of the KineticLaw's "math" element, is always in the model's
I<substance> per I<time> units.  However, the rate of change of the
species will involve the species' I<substance> units (i.e., the units
identified by the Species object's "substanceUnits" attribute), and
these units may be different from the model's default I<substance>
units.  If the units I<are> different, the stoichiometry must
incorporate a conversion factor for converting the model's I<substance>
units to the species' I<substance> units.  The conversion factor is
assumed to be included in the scalar value of the "stoichiometry"
attribute if "stoichiometry" is used.  If instead "stoichiometryMath" is
used, then the product of the model's "substance" units times the
"stoichiometryMath" units must match the I<substance> units of the
species.  Note that in either case, if the species' units and the
model's default I<substance> units are the same, the stoichiometry ends
up being a dimensionless number and equivalent to the standard chemical
stoichiometry found in textbooks.  Examples and more explanations of
this are given in the SBML specification.
The following is a simple example of a species reference for species @c
"X0", with stoichiometry C<2>, in a list of reactants within a reaction
having the identifier C<"J1">:
@verbatim
<model>
...
<listOfReactions>
<reaction id="J1">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="X0" stoichiometry="2">
</listOfReactants>
...
</reaction>
...
</listOfReactions>
...
</model>
@endverbatim
The following is a more complex example of a species reference for
species C<"X0">, with a stoichiometry formula consisting of
a rational number:
@verbatim
<model>
...
<listOfReactions>
<reaction id="J1">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="X0">
<stoichiometryMath>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> 
<cn type="rational"> 3 <sep/> 2 </cn>
</math>
</stoichiometryMath>
</speciesReference>
</listOfReactants>
...
</reaction>
...
</listOfReactions>
...
</model>
@endverbatim

Additional discussions of stoichiometries and implications for species
and reactions are included in the documentation of SpeciesReference
class.

@section l3-stoichiometries Stoichiometries in SBML Level 3
The StoichiometryMath construct is not defined in SBML Level&nbsp;3
Version&nbsp;1 Core.  Instead, Level&nbsp;3 defines the identifier of
SpeciesReference objects as a stand-in for the stoichiometry of the
reactant or product being referenced, and allows that identifier to be
used elsewhere in SBML models, including (for example) InitialAssignment
objects.  This makes it possible to achieve the same effect as
StoichiometryMath, but with other SBML objects.  For instance, to
produce a stoichiometry value that is a rational number, a model can use
InitialAssignment to assign the identifier of a SpeciesReference object
to a MathML expression evaluating to a rational number.  This is
analogous to the same way that, in Level&nbsp;2, the model would use
StoichiometryMath with a MathML expression evaluating to a rational
number.

In SBML Level 2, the stoichiometry of a reactant or product is a
combination of both a <em>biochemical stoichiometry</em> (meaning, the
standard stoichiometry of a species in a reaction) and any necessary
unit conversion factors. The introduction of an explicit attribute on
the Species object for a conversion factor allows Level&nbsp;3 to avoid
having to overload the meaning of stoichiometry.  In Level&nbsp;3, the
stoichiometry given by a SpeciesReference object in a reaction is a
"proper" biochemical stoichiometry, meaning a dimensionless number free
of unit conversions.

=head2 SBMLNamespaces

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Class to store SBML level, version and namespace
information.

@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
There are differences in the definitions of components between different
SBML Levels, as well as Versions within Levels.  For example, the
"sboTerm" attribute was not introduced until Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;2, and then only on certain component classes; the SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3 specification moved the "sboTerm" attribute
to the SBase class, thereby allowing nearly all components to have SBO
annotations.  As a result of differences such as those, libSBML needs to
track the SBML Level and Version of every object created.
The purpose of the SBMLNamespaces object class is to make it easier to
communicate SBML Level and Version data between libSBML constructors and
other methods.  The SBMLNamespaces object class tracks 3-tuples
(triples) consisting of SBML Level, Version, and the corresponding SBML
XML namespace.
The plural name (SBMLNamespaces) is not a mistake, because in SBML
Level&nbsp;3, objects may have extensions added by Level&nbsp;3 packages
used by a given model and therefore may have multiple namespaces
associated with them; however, until the introduction of SBML
Level&nbsp;3, the SBMLNamespaces object only records one SBML
Level/Version/namespace combination at a time.  Most constructors for
SBML objects in libSBML take a SBMLNamespaces object as an argument,
thereby allowing the constructor to produce the proper combination of
attributes and other internal data structures for the given SBML Level
and Version.

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Class of exceptions thrown by constructors of some

In some situations, constructors for SBML objects may need to indicate to
callers that the creation of the object failed.  The failure may be for
different reasons, such as an attempt to use invalid parameters or a
system condition such as a memory error.  To communicate this to callers,
those classes will throw an SBMLConstructorException.
In languages that don't have an exception mechanism (e.g., C), the

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Class of object that encapsulates a conversion option.
@htmlinclude libsbml-facility-only-warning.html
LibSBML provides a number of converters that can perform transformations
on SBML documents.  These converters allow their behaviors to be
controlled by setting property values.  Converter properties are
communicated using objects of class ConversionProperties, and within
such objects, individual options are encapsulated using ConversionOption
objects.

A ConversionOption object consists of four parts:
@li A I<key>, acting as the name of the option;
@li A I<value> of this option;
@li A I<type> for the value; this is chosen from  the enumeration type
<a class="el" href="#ConversionOptionType_t">ConversionOptionType_t</a>; and
@li A I<description> consisting of a text string that describes the
option in some way.
There are no constraints on the values of keys or descriptions;
authors of SBML converters are free to choose them as they see fit.
@section ConversionOptionType_t Conversion option data types
An option in ConversionOption must have a data type declared, to
indicate whether it is a string value, an integer, and so forth.  The
possible types of values are taken from the enumeration <a
class="el" href="#ConversionOptionType_t">ConversionOptionType_t</a>.
The following are the possible values:
<p>
<center>
<table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" class="normal-font">

=head2 SBMLConverter

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Base class for SBML converters.
@htmlinclude libsbml-facility-only-warning.html
The SBMLConverter class is the base class for the various SBML @em
converters: classes of objects that transform or convert SBML documents.
These transformations can involve essentially anything that can be
written algorithmically; examples include converting the units of
measurement in a model, or converting from one Level+Version combination
of SBML to another.
LibSBML provides a number of built-in converters, and applications can
create their own by subclassing SBMLConverter and following the examples
of the existing converters.  The following are the built-in converters
in libSBML @htmlinclude libsbml-version.html:
@li SBMLFunctionDefinitionConverter
@li SBMLInitialAssignmentConverter
@li SBMLLevelVersionConverter
@li SBMLRuleConverter
@li SBMLStripPackageConverter
@li SBMLUnitsConverter
Many converters provide the ability to configure their behavior to some
extent.  This is realized through the use of I<properties> that offer
different I<options>.  Two related classes implement these features:
ConversionProperties and ConversionOptions.  The default property values
for each converter can be interrogated using the method
SBMLConverter::getDefaultProperties() on the converter class.

A given converter exposes one or more properties that can be adjusted

meant to be called in order to discover all the settings for the

Returns the target SBML namespaces of the currently set properties.
SBML namespaces are used by libSBML to express the Level+Version of
the SBML document (and, possibly, any SBML Level&nbsp;3 packages in
use). Some converters' behavior is affected by the SBML namespace
configured in the converter.  For example, the actions of

=head2 SBMLConverterRegistry

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Registry of all SBML converters.
@htmlinclude libsbml-facility-only-warning.html
LibSBML provides facilities for transforming and converting SBML
documents in various ways.  These transformations can involve
essentially anything that can be written algorithmically; examples
include converting the units of measurement in a model, or converting
from one Level+Version combination of SBML to another.  Converters are
implemented as objects derived from the class SBMLConverter.
The converter registry, implemented as a singleton object of class
SBMLConverterRegistry, maintains a list of known converters and provides
methods for discovering them.  Callers can use the method
SBMLConverterRegistry::getNumConverters() to find out how many
converters are registered, then use
SBMLConverterRegistry::getConverterByIndex(@if java int index@endif) to
iterate over each one; alternatively, callers can use
SBMLConverterRegistry::getConverterFor(@if java const ConversionProperties& props@endif)
to search for a converter having specific properties.

=over

Prior to using the registry, callers have to obtain a copy of the
registry.  This static method provides the means for doing that.

@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_INVALID_OBJECT LIBSBML_INVALID_OBJECT @endlink


=item SBMLConverterRegistry::getConverterByIndex

Returns the converter with the given index number.
Converters are given arbitrary index numbers by the registry.  Callers
can use the method SBMLConverterRegistry::getNumConverters() to find
out how many converters are registered, then use this method to
iterate over the list and obtain each one in turn.
@param index the zero-based index of the converter to fetch.
@return the converter with the given index number, or C<NULL> if the
number is less than C<0> or there is no converter at the given index
position.


=item SBMLConverterRegistry::getConverterFor

Returns the converter that best matches the given configuration
properties.

Many converters provide the ability to configure their behavior.  This
is realized through the use of I<properties> that offer different @em
options.  The present method allows callers to search for converters
that have specific property values.  Callers can do this by creating a
ConversionProperties object, adding the desired option(s) to the
object, then passing the object to this method.

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html SBML converter for replacing function definitions.
@htmlinclude libsbml-facility-only-warning.html
This is an SBML converter for manipulating user-defined functions in an
SBML file.  When invoked on the current model, it performs the following
operation:
<ol>
<li>Read the list of user-defined functions in the model (i.e., the
list of FunctionDefinition objects);
<li>Look for invocations of the function in mathematical expressions
throughout the model; and
<li>For each invocation found, replaces the invocation with a
in-line copy of the function's body, similar to how macro expansions
might be performed in scripting and programming languages.
</ol>

For example, suppose the model contains a function definition
representing the function <i>f(x, y) = x   y</i>.  Further
suppose this functions invoked somewhere else in the model, in
a mathematical formula, as <i>f(s, p)</i>.  The outcome of running
SBMLFunctionDefinitionConverter on the model will be to replace
the call to <i>f</i> with the expression <i>s   p</i>.

=head2 SBMLRuleConverter

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html SBML converter for reordering rules and assignments in a
model.

@htmlinclude libsbml-facility-only-warning.html
This converter reorders assignments in a model.  Specifically, it sorts
the list of assignment rules (i.e., the AssignmentRule objects contained
in the ListOfAssignmentRules within the Model object) and the initial
assignments (i.e., the InitialAssignment objects contained in the
ListOfInitialAssignments) such that, within each set, assignments that
depend on prior values are placed after the values are set.  For
example, if there is an assignment rule stating <i>a = b + 1</i>, and
another rule stating <i>b = 3</i>, the list of rules is sorted and the
rules are arranged so that the rule for <i>b = 3</i> appears I<before>
the rule for <i>a = b + 1</i>.  Similarly, if dependencies of this
sort exist in the list of initial assignments in the model, the initial
assignments are sorted as well.
Beginning with SBML Level 2, assignment rules have no ordering
required&mdash;the order in which the rules appear in an SBML file has
no significance.  Software tools, however, may need to reorder
assignments for purposes of evaluating them.  For example, for
simulators that use time integration methods, it would be a good idea to
reorder assignment rules such as the following,
<i>b = a + 10 seconds</i><br>
<i>a = time</i>
so that the evaluation of the rules is independent of integrator
step sizes. (This is due to the fact that, in this case, the order in
which the rules are evaluated changes the result.)  This converter
can be used to reorder the SBML objects regardless of whether the
input file contained them in the desired order.  Here is a code
fragment to illustrate how to do that:
@verbatim
ConversionProperties props;
props.addOption("sortRules", true, "sort rules");
SBMLConverter converter;
converter.setProperties(&props);
converter.setDocument(&doc);
converter.convert(); 
@endverbatim
@note The two sets of assignments (list of assignment rules on the one
hand, and list of initial assignments on the other hand) are handled @em
independently.  In an SBML model, these entities are treated differently
and no amount of sorting can deal with inter-dependencies between
assignments of the two kinds.

any reactions in the model, the C<extentUnits> attribute on the Model
object must also be set.

=head2 SBMLValidator

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Base class for SBML validators
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
LibSBML implements facilities for verifying that a given SBML document
is valid according to the SBML specifications; it also exposes the
validation interface so that user programs and SBML Level&nbsp;3 package
authors may use the facilities to implement new validators.  There are
two main interfaces to libSBML's validation facilities, based on the
classes Validator and SBMLValidator.
The Validator class is the basis of the system for validating an SBML
document against the validation rules defined in the SBML
specifications.  The scheme used by Validator relies is compact and uses
the I<visitor> programming pattern, but it relies on C/C++ features and
is not directly accessible from language bindings.  SBMLValidator offers
a framework for straightforward class-based extensibility, so that user
code can subclass SBMLValidator to implement new validation systems,
different validators can be introduced or turned off at run-time, and
interfaces can be provided in the libSBML language bindings.
SBMLValidator can call Validator functionality internally (as is the
case in the current implementation of SBMLInternalValidator) or use
entirely different implementation approaches, as necessary.
Users of libSBML may already be familiar with the facilities encompassed
by the validation system, in the form of the consistency-checking methods
defined on SBMLDocument.  The methods SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks(@if java int categ, boolean onoff@endif),
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency(), SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency()
and other method of that sort are in fact implemented via SBMLValidator,
specifically as methods on the class SBMLInternalValidator.
Authors may use SBMLValidator as the base class for their own validator
extensions to libSBML.  The class SBMLInternalValidator may serve as a
code example for how to implement such things.

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of a
mathematical expression.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) are a simple kind of data structure used in
libSBML for storing mathematical expressions.  The ASTNode is the
cornerstone of libSBML's AST representation.  An AST "node" represents the
most basic, indivisible part of a mathematical formula and come in many
types.  For instance, there are node types to represent numbers (with
subtypes to distinguish integer, real, and rational numbers), names
(e.g., constants or variables), simple mathematical operators, logical
or relational operators and functions. LibSBML ASTs provide a canonical,
in-memory representation for all mathematical formulas regardless of
their original format (which might be MathML or might be text strings).

are in a simple C-inspired infix notation.  A
formula in this text-string form can be handed to a program that
understands SBML mathematical expressions, or used as part
of a translation system.  The libSBML distribution comes with an example
program in the C<"examples"> subdirectory called C<translateMath> that
implements an interactive command-line demonstration of translating
infix formulas into MathML and vice-versa.
The formula strings may contain operators, function calls, symbols, and
white space characters.  The allowable white space characters are tab
and space.  The following are illustrative examples of formulas
expressed in the syntax:
@verbatim
0.10   k4^2
@endverbatim
@verbatim
(vm   s1)/(km + s1)
@endverbatim
The following table shows the precedence rules in this syntax.  In the
Class column, I<operand> implies the construct is an operand, @em
prefix implies the operation is applied to the following arguments, @em
unary implies there is one argument, and I<binary> implies there are
two arguments.  The values in the Precedence column show how the order
of different types of operation are determined.  For example, the
expression <em>a   b + c</em> is evaluated as <em>(a   b) + c</em>
because the C< > operator has higher precedence.  The
Associates column shows how the order of similar precedence operations
is determined; for example, <em>a - b + c</em> is evaluated as <em>(a -
b) + c</em> because the C<+> and C<-> operators are
left-associative.  The precedence and associativity rules are taken from
the C programming language, except for the symbol C<^>, which
is used in C for a different purpose.  (Exponentiation can be invoked
using either C<^> or the function C<power>.)
@htmlinclude math-precedence-table.html 
A program parsing a formula in an SBML model should assume that names
appearing in the formula are the identifiers of Species, Parameter,
Compartment, FunctionDefinition, Reaction (in SBML Levels&nbsp;2
and&nbsp;3), or SpeciesReference (in SBML Level&nbsp;3 only) objects
defined in a model.  When a function call is involved, the syntax
consists of a function identifier, followed by optional white space,
followed by an opening parenthesis, followed by a sequence of zero or
more arguments separated by commas (with each comma optionally preceded
and/or followed by zero or more white space characters), followed by a
closing parenthesis.  There is an almost one-to-one mapping between the
list of predefined functions available, and those defined in MathML.
All of the MathML functions are recognized; this set is larger than the
functions defined in SBML Level&nbsp;1.  In the subset of functions that
overlap between MathML and SBML Level&nbsp;1, there exist a few
differences.  The following table summarizes the differences between the
predefined functions in SBML Level&nbsp;1 and the MathML equivalents in
SBML Levels&nbsp;2 and &nbsp;3:

=item ASTNode::ASTNode

Creates and returns a new ASTNode.
Unless the argument C<type> is given, the returned node will by
default have a type of @link ASTNodeType_t#AST_UNKNOWN
AST_UNKNOWN@endlink.  If the type isn't supplied when caling this
constructor, the caller should set the node type to something else as
soon as possible using

Copy constructor; creates a deep copy of the given ASTNode.
@param orig the ASTNode to be copied.


=item ASTNode::freeName

Frees the name of this ASTNode and sets it to C<NULL>.
This operation is only applicable to ASTNode objects corresponding to
operators, numbers, or @link ASTNodeType_t#AST_UNKNOWN
AST_UNKNOWN@endlink.  This method has no effect on other types of
nodes.

@return integer value indicating success/failure of the
function.  The possible values returned by this function are:
@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS @endlink
@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_UNEXPECTED_ATTRIBUTE LIBSBML_UNEXPECTED_ATTRIBUTE @endlink


=item ASTNode::canonicalize

Converts this ASTNode to a canonical form and returns C<true> if
successful, C<false> otherwise.
The rules determining the canonical form conversion are as follows:
\n=over\n

\n=item\n\nIf the node type is @link ASTNodeType_t#AST_NAME AST_NAME@endlink
and the node name matches C<"ExponentialE">, C<"Pi">, C<"True"> or @c
"False" the node type is converted to the corresponding 
C<AST_CONSTANT_><em><span class="placeholder">X</span></em> type.
\n=item\n\nIf the node type is an @link ASTNodeType_t#AST_FUNCTION
AST_FUNCTION@endlink and the node name matches an SBML (MathML) function name, logical operator name, or
relational operator name, the node is converted to the corresponding
C<AST_FUNCTION_><em><span class="placeholder">X</span></em> or
C<AST_LOGICAL_><em><span class="placeholder">X</span></em> type.
\n=back\n

SBML Level&nbsp;1 function names are searched first; thus, for
example, canonicalizing C<log> will result in a node type of @link
ASTNodeType_t#AST_FUNCTION_LN AST_FUNCTION_LN@endlink.  (See the SBML
Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;2 Specification, Appendix C.)
Sometimes, canonicalization of a node results in a structural
conversion of the node as a result of adding a child.  For example, a
node with the SBML Level&nbsp;1 function name C<sqr> and a single
child node (the argument) will be transformed to a node of type
@link ASTNodeType_t#AST_FUNCTION_POWER AST_FUNCTION_POWER@endlink with
two children.  The first child will remain unchanged, but the second
child will be an ASTNode of type @link ASTNodeType_t#AST_INTEGER
AST_INTEGER@endlink and a value of 2.  The function names that result
in structural changes are: C<log10>, C<sqr>, and C<sqrt>.


=item ASTNode::addChild

except that this function uses the parser settings given in the argument
C<settings>.  The settings override the default parsing behavior.
The parameter C<settings> allows callers to change the following parsing
behaviors:

@li Use a specific Model object against which identifiers to compare
identifiers.  This causes the parser to search the Model for identifiers
that the parser encounters in the formula.  If a given symbol in the
formula matches the identifier of a Species, Compartment, Parameter,
Reaction, SpeciesReference or FunctionDefinition in the Model, then the
symbol is assumed to refer to that model entity instead of any possible
mathematical terms with the same symbol.  For example, if the parser is
given a Model containing a Species with the identifier
&quot;C<pi>&quot;, and the formula to be parsed is
&quot;C<3 pi>&quot;, the MathML produced will contain the
construct C<&lt;ci&gt; pi &lt;/ci&gt;> instead of the
construct C<&lt;pi/&gt;>.
@li Whether to parse &quot;C<log(x)>&quot; with a single
argument as the base 10
logarithm of x, the natural logarithm of x, or treat the case as an
error.
@li Whether to parse &quot;C<number id>&quot; by interpreting
C<id> as the identifier of a unit of measurement associated with the
number, or whether to treat the case as an error.
@li Whether to parse &quot;C<avogadro>&quot; as an ASTNode of

Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), represented in libSBML using ASTNode
objects. Compared to the parser implemented by the function

which was designed primarily for converting the mathematical formula
strings in SBML Level&nbsp;1, the "L3" variant of the parser accepts an
extended formula syntax.  It also has a number of configurable behaviors.
This class (L3ParserSettings) is an object used to communicate the
configuration settings with callers.
The following aspects of the parser are configurable:
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\nThe function C<log> with a single argument (&quot;C<log(x)>&quot;) 
can be parsed as C<log10(x)>, C<ln(x)>, or treated
as an error, as desired.
\n=item\n\nUnary minus signs can be collapsed or preserved; that is,
sequential pairs of unary minuses (e.g., &quot;C<- -3>&quot;)
can be removed from the input entirely and single unary minuses can be
incorporated into the number node, or all minuses can be preserved in
the AST node structure.
\n=item\n\nParsing of units embedded in the input string can be turned on and
off.
\n=item\n\nThe string C<avogadro> can be parsed as a MathML I<csymbol> or
as an identifier.
\n=item\n\nA Model object may optionally be provided to the parser using
the variant function call @if clike  SBML_parseL3FormulaWithModel()@endif@if csharp  SBML_parseL3FormulaWithModel()@endif@if python  libsbml.SBML_parseL3FormulaWithModel()@endif@if java <code><a href="libsbml.html#parseL3FormulaWithModel(java.lang.String, org.sbml.libsbml.Model)">libsbml.parseL3FormulaWithModel(String formula, Model model)</a></code>@endif@~.
or stored in a L3ParserSettings object passed to the variant function
@if clike SBML_parseL3FormulaWithSettings()@endif@if csharp SBML_parseL3FormulaWithSettings()@endif@if python libsbml.parseL3FormulaWithSettings()@endif@if java <code><a href="libsbml.html#parseL3FormulaWithSettings(java.lang.String, org.sbml.libsbml.L3ParserSettings)">libsbml.parseL3FormulaWithSettings(String formula, org.sbml.libsbml.L3ParserSettings settings)</a></code>@endif@~.
When a Model object is provided, identifiers (values of type C<SId>)
from that model are used in preference to pre-defined MathML
definitions.  More precisely, the Model entities whose identifiers will
shadow identical symbols in the mathematical formula are: Species,
Compartment, Parameter, Reaction, and SpeciesReference.  For instance,
if the parser is given a Model containing a Species with the identifier
&quot;C<pi>&quot;, and the formula to be parsed is
&quot;C<3 pi>&quot;, the MathML produced will contain the
construct C<&lt;ci&gt; pi &lt;/ci&gt;> instead of the
construct C<&lt;pi/&gt;>.
\n=item\n\nSimilarly, when a Model object is provided, C<SId> values of
user-defined functions present in the Model will be used preferentially
over pre-defined MathML functions.  For example, if the passed-in Model
contains a FunctionDefinition with the identifier
&quot;C<sin>&quot;, that function will be used instead of the
predefined MathML function C<&lt;sin/&gt;>.
\n=back\n

=item L3ParserSettings::setParseCollapseMinus

Sets the behavior for handling unary minuses appearing in mathematical
formulas.

This setting affects two behaviors.  First, pairs of multiple unary
minuses in a row (e.g., &quot;C<- -3>&quot;) can be
collapsed and ignored in the input, or the multiple minuses can be
preserved in the AST node tree that is generated by the parser.
Second, minus signs in front of numbers can be collapsed into the
number node itself; for example, a &quot;C<- 4.1>&quot; can
be turned into a single ASTNode of type @link ASTNodeType_t#AST_REAL
AST_REAL@endlink with a value of C<-4.1>, or it can be
turned into a node of type @link ASTNodeType_t#AST_MINUS
AST_MINUS@endlink having a child node of type @link
ASTNodeType_t#AST_REAL AST_REAL@endlink.  This method lets you tell
the parser which behavior to use&mdash;either collapse minuses or

following constants:
@li @link ParseLogType_t#L3P_COLLAPSE_UNARY_MINUS

@see setParseCollapseMinus(@if java boolean collapseminus@endif)


=item L3ParserSettings::setParseUnits

Sets the parser's behavior in handling units associated with numbers
in a mathematical formula.
In SBML Level&nbsp;2, there is no means of associating a unit of
measurement with a pure number in a formula, while SBML Level&nbsp;3
does define a syntax for this.  In Level&nbsp;3, MathML
C<&lt;cn&gt;> elements can have an attribute named C<units>
placed in the SBML namespace, which can be used to indicate the units
to be associated with the number.  The text-string infix formula
parser allows units to be placed after raw numbers; they are
interpreted as unit identifiers for units defined by the SBML
specification or in the containing Model object.  Some examples
include: &quot;C<4 mL>&quot;, &quot;C<2.01
Hz>&quot;, &quot;C<3.1e-6 M>&quot;, and
&quot;C<(5/8) inches>&quot;.  To produce a valid SBML model,
there must either exist a UnitDefinition corresponding to the
identifier of the unit, or the unit must be defined in Table&nbsp;2 of
the SBML specification.
@param units A boolean indicating whether to parse units:
@li @link ParseLogType_t#L3P_PARSE_UNITS L3P_PARSE_UNITS@endlink
(value = C<true>): parse units in the text-string formula.
@li @link ParseLogType_t#L3P_NO_UNITS L3P_NO_UNITS@endlink (value = @c
false): treat units in the text-string formula as errors.
@see getParseUnits()


=item L3ParserSettings::getParseUnits

Returns C<if> the current settings allow units in text-string
mathematical formulas.
In SBML Level&nbsp;2, there is no means of associating a unit of
measurement with a pure number in a formula, while SBML Level&nbsp;3
does define a syntax for this.  In Level&nbsp;3, MathML
C<&lt;cn&gt;> elements can have an attribute named C<units>
placed in the SBML namespace, which can be used to indicate the units

&quot;C<(5/8) inches>&quot;.  To produce a valid SBML model,
there must either exist a UnitDefinition corresponding to the
identifier of the unit, or the unit must be defined in Table&nbsp;2 of
the SBML specification.
Since SBML Level&nbsp;2 does not have the ability to associate units with
pure numbers, the value should be set to C<false> when parsing text-string
formulas intended for use in SBML Level&nbsp;2 documents.
@return A boolean indicating whether to parse units:

=item L3ParserSettings::setParseAvogadroCsymbol

Sets the parser's behavior in handling the string C<avogadro> in
mathematical formulas.
SBML Level&nbsp;3 defines a symbol for representing the value of
Avogadro's constant, but it is not defined in SBML Level&nbsp;2.  As a
result, the text-string formula parser must behave differently
depending on which SBML Level is being targeted.  The argument to this
method can be one of two values:
@li @link ParseLogType_t#L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_CSYMBOL
L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_CSYMBOL@endlink (value = C<true>): tells the parser to
translate the string C<avogadro> (in any capitalization) into an AST
node of type @link ASTNodeType_t#AST_NAME_AVOGADRO
AST_NAME_AVOGADRO@endlink.
@li @link ParseLogType_t#L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_NAME
L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_NAME@endlink (value = C<false>): tells the parser to
translate the string C<avogadro> into an AST of type @link
ASTNodeType_t#AST_NAME AST_NAME@endlink.
Since SBML Level&nbsp;2 does not define a symbol for Avogadro's
constant, the value should be set to C<false> when parsing text-string
formulas intended for use in SBML Level&nbsp;2 documents.
@param l2only a boolean value (one of the constants
@link ParseLogType_t#L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_CSYMBOL
L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_CSYMBOL@endlink or
@link ParseLogType_t#L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_NAME

Returns C<true> if the current settings are oriented towards handling
C<avogadro> for SBML Level&nbsp;3.
SBML Level&nbsp;3 defines a symbol for representing the value of
Avogadro's constant, but it is not defined in SBML Level&nbsp;2.  As a

to callers that the creation of the object failed.  The failure may be
for different reasons, such as an attempt to use invalid parameters or a
system condition such as a memory error.  To communicate this to
callers, those classes will throw an XMLConstructorException.  @if cpp

=head2 XMLConstructorException

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Class of exceptions thrown by constructors of some
libSBML objects.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
In some situations, constructors for SBML objects may need to indicate
to callers that the creation of the object failed.  The failure may be
for different reasons, such as an attempt to use invalid parameters or a
system condition such as a memory error.  To communicate this to
callers, those classes will throw an XMLConstructorException.  @if cpp
Callers can use the standard C++ C<std::exception> method
C<what()> to extract the diagnostic message stored with the
exception.@endif@~
<p>
In languages that don't have an exception mechanism (e.g., C), the
constructors generally try to return an error code instead of throwing
an exception.

=head2 XMLNamespaces

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of XML Namespaces.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
This class serves to organize functionality for tracking XML namespaces
in a document or data stream.  The namespace declarations are stored as
a list of pairs of XML namespace URIs and prefix strings.  These
correspond to the parts of a namespace declaration on an XML element.
For example, in the following XML fragment,
@verbatim
<annotation>
<mysim:nodecolors xmlns:mysim="urn:lsid:mysim.org"
mysim:bgcolor="green" mysim:fgcolor="white"/>
</annotation>
@endverbatim
there is one namespace declaration.  Its URI is
C<urn:lsid:mysim.org> and its prefix is C<mysim>.
This pair could be stored as one item in an XMLNamespaces list.
XMLNamespaces provides various methods for manipulating the list of
prefix-URI pairs.  Individual namespaces stored in a given XMLNamespace
object instance can be retrieved based on their index using
XMLNamespaces::getPrefix(int index), or by their characteristics such as
their URI or position in the list.

=item XMLNamespaces::XMLNamespaces

=item XMLNamespaces::clone

@return a (deep) copy of this XMLNamespaces list.


=item XMLNamespaces::add

Appends an XML namespace prefix and URI pair to this list of namespace
declarations.

An XMLNamespaces object stores a list of pairs of namespaces and their
prefixes.  If there is an XML namespace with the given C<uri> prefix
in this list, then its corresponding URI will be overwritten by the
new C<uri> unless the uri represents the core sbml namespace.
Calling programs could use one of the other XMLNamespaces
methods, such as
XMLNamespaces::hasPrefix(@if java String@endif) and 
XMLNamespaces::hasURI(@if java String@endif) to
inquire whether a given prefix and/or URI
is already present in this XMLNamespaces object.
If the C<uri> represents the sbml namespaces then it will not be
overwritten, as this has potentially serious consequences. If it
is necessary to replace the sbml namespace the namespace should be removed
prior to adding the new namespace.
@param uri a string, the uri for the namespace

=head2 XMLNode

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of a node in an XML document tree.
Beginning with version 3.0.0, libSBML implements an XML abstraction
layer.  This layer presents a uniform XML interface to calling programs
regardless of which underlying XML parser libSBML has actually been
configured to use.  The basic data object in the XML abstraction is a
I<node>, represented by XMLNode.
An XMLNode can contain any number of children.  Each child is another
XMLNode, thereby forming a tree.  The methods XMLNode::getNumChildren()
and XMLNode::getChild(@if java long n@endif) can be used to access the tree
structure starting from a given node.
Each XMLNode is subclassed from XMLToken, and thus has the same methods
available as XMLToken.  These methods include XMLToken::getNamespaces(),
XMLToken::getPrefix(), XMLToken::getName(), XMLToken::getURI(), and
XMLToken::getAttributes().

@section xmlnode-str2xmlnode Conversion between an XML string and an XMLNode
LibSBML provides the following utility functions for converting an XML
string (e.g., C<&lt;annotation&gt;...&lt;/annotation&gt;>)
to/from an XMLNode object.
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\nXMLNode::toXMLString() returns a string representation of the XMLNode object. 
\n=item\n\nXMLNode::convertXMLNodeToString(@if java XMLNode node@endif)
(static function) returns a string representation 
of the given XMLNode object.
\n=item\n\nXMLNode::convertStringToXMLNode(@if java String xml@endif)
(static function) returns an XMLNode object converted 
from the given XML string.
\n=back\n

The returned XMLNode object by XMLNode::convertStringToXMLNode(@if java String xml@endif)
is a dummy root (container) XMLNode if the given XML string has two or
more top-level elements (e.g.,
&quot;C<&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;>&quot;). In the
dummy root node, each top-level element in the given XML string is
contained as a child XMLNode. XMLToken::isEOF() can be used to identify
if the returned XMLNode object is a dummy node or not.  Here is an
example: @if clike
@verbatim
// Checks if the XMLNode object returned by XMLNode::convertStringToXMLNode() is a dummy root node:
std::string str = "..."; 
XMLNode  xn = XMLNode::convertStringToXMLNode(str);

=head2 XMLTriple

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of a qualified XML name.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
A "triple" in the libSBML XML layer encapsulates the notion of qualified
name, meaning an element name or an attribute name with an optional
namespace qualifier.  An XMLTriple instance carries up to three data items:
\n=over\n

\n=item\n\nThe name of the attribute or element; that is, the attribute name
as it appears in an XML document or data stream;
\n=item\n\nThe XML namespace prefix (if any) of the attribute.  For example,
in the following fragment of XML, the namespace prefix is the string
C<mysim> and it appears on both the element
C<someelement> and the attribute C<attribA>.  When
both the element and the attribute are stored as XMLTriple objects,
their <i>prefix</i> is C<mysim>.
@verbatim
<mysim:someelement mysim:attribA="value" />
@endverbatim
\n=item\n\nThe XML namespace URI with which the prefix is associated.  In
XML, every namespace used must be declared and mapped to a URI.
\n=back\n

XMLTriple objects are the lowest-level data item in the XML layer
of libSBML.  Other objects such as XMLToken make use of XMLTriple
objects.

=head2 XMLError

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of errors, warnings and other diagnostics
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
LibSBML can be configured to use any of a number of XML parsers; at the
time of this writing, libSBML supports Xerces versions 2.4 through 3.1,
Expat version 1.95.x and higher, and libxml2 version 2.6.16 and higher.
These parsers each report different status codes for the various
exceptions that can occur during XML processing.  The XMLError object
class abstracts away from the particular diagnostics reported by the
different parsers and presents a single uniform interface and set of
status codes, along with operations for manipulating the error objects.
When the libSBML XML parser layer encounters an error in the XML content
being processed, or when there is something else wrong (such as an
out-of-memory condition), the problems are reported as XMLError objects.
Each XMLError object instance has an identification number that
identifies the nature of the problem.
@if clike This error identifier will be up to five digits 
long and drawn from the enumeration <a class="el"
href="#error-codes">XMLErrorCode_t</a>.  Applications can use the
error identifiers as a means of recognizing the error encountered and
changing their behavior if desired. @else This
error identifier is one of the constants listed in the next section below.
Applications can use the error identifiers as a means of recognizing the
error encountered and changing their behavior if desired.  @endif@~
Integer error codes are useful for software, but not so much for telling
humans what happened.  For this reason, XMLError also provides two text
messages describing the nature of the error.  These messages are
accessible by means of the methods XMLError::getShortMessage() and
XMLError::getMessage().  The method XMLError::getShortMessage() returns
a very brief synopsis of the warning or error condition, whereas
XMLError::getMessage() returns a longer explanation.  These text strings
are suitable for displaying to human users.
Each XMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
retrieved using the method XMLError::getCategory().  Category values
are drawn from @if clike the enumeration <a class="el" href="#XMLErrorCategory_t">XMLErrorCategory_t</a> described below.@else a
set of constants whose names begin with the characters C<LIBSBML_CAT_>, described below.@endif@~ &nbsp;Categories
are used by libSBML to provide more information to calling programs about
the nature of a given error.  
In addition to category codes, each XMLError object also has a severity
code; its value may be retrieved using the method
XMLError::getSeverity().  Severity code values are drawn from
@if clike the enumeration <a class="el" href="#XMLErrorSeverity_t">XMLErrorSeverity_t</a>@else a
set of constants whose names begin with the characters C<LIBSBML_SEV_@endif>,
described below. Severity levels range from informational
(@link XMLErrorSeverity_t#LIBSBML_SEV_INFO LIBSBML_SEV_INFO@endlink) to
fatal errors (@link XMLErrorSeverity_t#LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL@endlink).
Finally, XMLError objects record the line and column near where the
problem occurred in the XML content.  The values can be retrieved using
the methods XMLError::getLine() and XMLError::getColumn().  We say "near
where the problem occurred", because many factors affect how accurate
the line/column information ultimately is.  For example, sometimes, the
underlying XML parsers can only report such information for the parent
XML element where an error occurs, and not for the specific point where
the problem occurs.  In other situations, some parsers report invalid
line and/or column numbers altogether.  If this occurs, libSBML sets the
line and/or column number in the XMLError object to either
C<0> or the value of the maximum unsigned long integer
representable on the platform where libSBML is running.  The probability
that a true line or column number in an SBML model would equal this
value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application encounters these
values in an XMLError object, it can assume no valid line/column number
could be provided by libSBML in that situation.

=item XMLError::XMLError

Creates a new XMLError to report that something occurred during XML
processing.

XMLError objects have identification numbers to indicate the nature of
the exception.  @if clike These numbers are drawn from
the enumeration <a class="el"
href="#error-codes">XMLErrorCode_t</a>.
@else These numbers are defined as unsigned 
integer constants in the file
"libsbmlConstants.java".  See the <a class="el"
href="#error-codes">top of this documentation</a> for a table
listing the possible values and their meanings. @endif@~ The argument @p
errorId to this constructor I<can> be (but does not have to be) a
value from this @if clike enumeration. If it is a value
from <a class="el" href="#error-codes">XMLErrorCode_t</a>, the
XMLError class assumes the error is a low-level system or XML layer
error and <em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to
any string passed in the argument C<details> to this constructor.  In
addition, all <a class="el" href="#error-codes">XMLErrorCode_t</a>
errors have associated values for the C<severity> and C<category>
codes, and these fields are filled-in as well from the enumerations <a
class="el" href="#error-severities">XMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a
class="el" href="#error-categories">XMLErrorCategory_t</a>,
respectively. @else set of constants.  If it is
one of the predefined error identifiers, the XMLError class assumes
the error is a low-level system or XML layer error and
<em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to any string
passed in the argument C<details> to this constructor.  In addition,
all the predefined error identifiers have associated values for the @p
severity and C<category> codes, and these fields are filled-in as
well. @endif@~
If the error identifier C<errorId> is a number greater than 9999, this
constructor assumes that the error was generated from another part of
the software, and does not do additional filling in of values beyond
the defaults in the constructor itself.  This allows XMLError to serve
as a base class for other errors (and is used in this way elsewhere in
libSBML).  Callers should fill in all the parameters with suitable
values if generating errors with codes greater than 9999 to make
maximum use of the XMLError facilities.
@if clike As mentioned above, there are two other
enumerations, <a class="el"
href="#error-severities">XMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class="el"
href="#error-categories">XMLErrorCategory_t</a>, used for indicating
the severity and category of error for the predefined XMLError codes.
The values passed in C<severity> and C<category> override the defaults
assigned based on the error code.  If the value of C<errorId> is a
value from <a class="el" href="#error-codes">XMLErrorCode_t</a>,
callers do not need to fill in C<severity> and C<category>.
Conversely, if C<errorId> is not a value from <a class="el"
href="#error-codes">XMLErrorCode_t</a>, callers can use other
values (not just those from <a class="el"
href="#error-severities">XMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class="el"
href="#error-categories">XMLErrorCategory_t</a>, but their own
special values) for C<severity> and @p
category. @else As mentioned above, 
there are additional constants defined for <a class="el"
href="#error-severities">standard severity</a> and <a class="el"
href="#error-categories">standard category</a> codes, and every predefined 
error in libSBML has an associated value for severity and category taken
from these predefined sets.  These constants have symbol names
prefixed with C<LIBSBML_SEV_> and C<LIBSBML_CAT_>,
respectively.  If the value of C<errorId> is one of the standard error
codes, callers do not need to fill in C<severity> and C<category> in a
call to this constructor.  Conversely, if C<errorId> is not an existing
XML-level error code, callers can use other values for C<severity> and
C<category>. @endif@~
@param errorId an unsigned int, the identification number of the error.
@param details a string containing additional details about the error.
If the error code in C<errorId> is one that is recognized by XMLError,
the given message is I<appended> to a predefined message associated
with the given code.  If the error code is not recognized, the message
is stored as-is as the text of the error.
@param line an unsigned int, the line number at which the error occured.

=item XMLError::getLine

Returns the line number in the XML input near where the error, warning
or other diagnostic occurred.
We say "near where the problem occurred", because many factors affect
how accurate the line/column information ultimately is.  For example,
sometimes, the underlying XML parsers can only report such information
for the parent XML element where an error occurs, and not for the
specific point where the problem occurs.  In other situations, some
parsers report invalid line and/or column numbers altogether.  If this
occurs, libSBML sets the line and/or column number in the XMLError
object to either C<0> or the value of the maximum unsigned
long integer representable on the platform where libSBML is running.
The probability that a true line or column number in an SBML model
would equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application
encounters these values in an XMLError object, it can assume no valid
line/column number could be provided by libSBML in that situation.
@return the line number

=item XMLError::getErrorIdOffset

Returns libSBML's internal numerical offset for the error code
associated with this error.
In the SBML Level&nbsp;3 package specifications, package validation
rules are identified by 5-digit numbers prefixed with the nickname of
the package itself&mdash;e.g., &ldquo;comp-10101&rdquo;,
&ldquo;fbc-20301&rdquo;, etc.  Historically, libSBML reported error
codes as pure integers, and some application software systems make
decisions based on the numerical values of the error codes.  To permit
these applications to continue to function in this fashion, libSBML
internally continues to maintain error identifiers as pure integers.  To
handle the possibility that errors may come from package extensions,
libSBML uses numerical offsets added to the internal error codes.  These
offsets add two leading digits to the regular 5-digit error codes; for
example, &ldquo;comp&rdquo; error codes are stored as 1010101, 1020102,
etc.  The offset in this case is 1000000.  Another package will have the
offset 2000000, yet another will have 3000000, etc.
This method returns the integer offset in this error's error code.
Calling applications can get the 5-digit package-specific number for a
given error code by subtracting the offset from the value reported by
getErrorId():
@verbatim
getErrorId() - getErrorIdOffset()
@endverbatim
When libSBML produces error messages, it combines the text string
returned by getPackage() with the subtracted value of the error code,
to produce a text string of the form &ldquo;comp-10101&rdquo;.

=head2 XMLErrorLog

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Log of errors and other events encountered while
processing an XML file or data stream.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
The error log is a list.  The XML layer of libSBML maintains an error
log associated with a given XML document or data stream.  When an
operation results in an error, or when there is something wrong with the
XML content, the problem is reported as an XMLError object stored in the
XMLErrorLog list.  Potential problems range from low-level issues (such
as the inability to open a file) to XML syntax errors (such as
mismatched tags or other problems).
A typical approach for using this error log is to first use
@if java XMLErrorLog::getNumErrors()@else getNumErrors()@endif@~
to inquire how many XMLError object instances it contains, and then to

getError(unsigned int n) const.  Indexing in the list begins at 0.
In normal circumstances, programs using libSBML will actually obtain an
SBMLErrorLog rather than an XMLErrorLog.  The former is subclassed from
XMLErrorLog and simply wraps commands for working with SBMLError objects
rather than the low-level XMLError objects.  Classes such as
SBMLDocument use the higher-level SBMLErrorLog.

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Log of errors and other events encountered during SBML
processing.

@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
The error log is a list.  Each SBMLDocument maintains its own
SBMLErrorLog.  When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in an
error, or when there is something worth noting about the SBML content,
the issue is reported as an SBMLError object stored in the SBMLErrorLog
list.

SBMLErrorLog is derived from XMLErrorLog, an object class that serves
exactly the same purpose but for the XML parsing layer.  XMLErrorLog
provides crucial methods such as
@if java XMLErrorLog::getNumErrors()@else getNumErrors()@endif@~
for determining how many SBMLError or XMLError objects are in the log.
SBMLErrorLog inherits these methods.
The general approach to working with SBMLErrorLog in user programs
involves first obtaining a pointer to a log from a libSBML object such
as SBMLDocument.  Callers should then use
@if java XMLErrorLog::getNumErrors()@else getNumErrors() @endif@~ to inquire how
many objects there are in the list.  (The answer may be 0.)  If there is
at least one SBMLError object in the SBMLErrorLog instance, callers can
then iterate over the list using
SBMLErrorLog::getError(@if java long n@endif)@if clike const@endif,
using methods provided by the SBMLError class to find out the error code
and associated information such as the error severity, the message, and
the line number in the input.
If you wish to simply print the error strings for a human to read, an
easier and more direct way might be to use SBMLDocument::printErrors().

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of errors, warnings and other diagnostics
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in an error, or when
there is something wrong with the SBML content, the problems are
reported as SBMLError objects.  These are generally stored in an
SBMLErrorLog object; this log object, in turn, is kept in the
SBMLDocument object containing the SBML content.  Applications can
obtain the list of logged errors using SBMLDocument::getErrorLog() and
then use the methods provided by SBMLErrorLog to access individual
SBMLError objects.  (Note that despite the word "error" in the name,
SBMLError objects are used to represent not only "true" errors, but also
warnings and some informational diagnostics.  The name is a historical
hold-over from early versions of libSBML, in which the object really was
only used to report errors.)
@if clike
Each SBMLError object instance has an identification number that
identifies the nature of the problem.  This "error id" number will be up
to five digits long, and it will be listed in one of two enumerations:
<a class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t"> SBMLErrorCode_t</a> (described <a
class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t"> below</a>) or @link
XMLError::XMLErrorCode_t XMLErrorCode_t @endlink (described in the
documentation for the class XMLError).  The former enumeration contains
all the SBML validation rule numbers listed in the appendices of the
SBML specification documents, as well as some additional
libSBML-specific error codes.
@endif@if java

@endif@~

Error codes are useful mainly for software.  For human readers,
SBMLError also includes text messages that describe the nature of a
given problem.  The messages can be accessed using
SBMLError::getShortMessage() and SBMLError::getMessage().  The former
provides a brief one-line description of the issue, while
SBMLError::getMessage() provides a more detailed text, including (if
appropriate) references to sections of the SBML specifications where
relevant topics are discussed.  These text strings are suitable for
displaying to human users.
@if clike
An SBMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
retrieved using the method SBMLError::getCategory().  Category values
are drawn from the enumeration <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorCategory_t">SBMLErrorCategory_t</a> described below.
Categories are used to partition errors into distinct conceptual groups.
This is principally used by the libSBML validation system to group
classes of validation checks.  For example, 
@link SBMLErrorCategory_t#LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY@endlink
is the category for tests that check identifier consistency;
@link SBMLErrorCategory_t#LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY@endlink
is the category for MathML consistency checking; and
so on.
@endif@if java
An SBMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
retrieved using the method SBMLError::getCategory().  Category values
are drawn from a set of static integer constants
defined in <code><a href="libsbmlConstants.html">libsbmlConstants</a></code>,
and having names beginning with the characters
C<LIBSBML_CAT_>.  The list of possible codes is described in a
separate section below.  Categories are used to partition errors into
distinct conceptual groups.  This is principally used by the libSBML
validation system to group classes of validation checks.  For example,
@link SBMLErrorCategory_t#LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY@endlink
is the category for tests that check identifier consistency;
@link SBMLErrorCategory_t#LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY@endlink

is the category for MathML consistency checking; and
so on.
@endif@~

In addition, SBMLError also has a severity code.  Its value may be
retrieved using the method SBMLError::getSeverity().  The possible
severity values are the same as those reported by @if clike XMLError.@endif@if python XMLError.@endif@if java <code><a href="XMLError.html">XMLError</a></code>.@endif@~ 
Severity levels currently range from informational
(@link XMLErrorSeverity_t#LIBSBML_SEV_INFO LIBSBML_SEV_INFO@endlink)
to fatal errors
(@link XMLErrorSeverity_t#LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL@endlink).
They can be
used by an application to evaluate how serious a given problem
is. 

Finally, SBMLError records the line and column near where the problem
occurred in the SBML content.  The values may be retrieved using the
methods SBMLError::getLine() and SBMLError::getColumn().  We say "near",
because a lot of factors affect how accurate the line/column information
ultimately is.  For example, different XML parsers have different
conventions for which line and column number they report for a
particular problem (which makes a difference when a problem involves an
opening XML tag on one line and a closing tag on another line).  In some
situations, some parsers report invalid line and/or column numbers
altogether.  If this occurs, libSBML sets the line and/or column number
in the SBMLError object to the the value of the maximum unsigned long
integer representable on the platform where libSBML is running.  (This
is equal to the constant named C<ULONG_MAX> in C and C++.)
The probability that a true line or column number in an SBML model would
equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application
encounters these values in an XMLError object, it can assume no valid
line/column number could be provided by libSBML in that situation.
@if clike
<h3><a class="anchor" name="SBMLErrorCode_t">SBMLErrorCode_t</a></h3>
SBMLErrorCode_t is an enumeration of all SBML-level error, warning and
informational diagnostic codes.  Every SBMLError object has an error
code value that can be either a value from this enumeration, or a value
from the @link XMLError::XMLErrorCode_t XMLErrorCode_t @endlink
enumeration (see the documentation for XMLError).  The latter values
apply when the error or warning signifies a basic XML issue rather than
an SBML issue per se.  The values of SBMLErrorCode_t are distinguished
from those of @link XMLError::XMLErrorCode_t XMLErrorCode_t @endlink by
being numbered 10000 and higher, while the XML layer's codes are 9999 and
lower.  The method SBMLError::getErrorId() returns the error code of a
given SBMLError object instance.
The following is a table of the symbolic names of SBMLErrorCode_t values
and the meaning of each code.  In this table, the right-hand columns
titled "L1V1", "L1V2", etc. refer to Levels and Versions of the SBML
specifications, and the entries in each column refer to whether the

Creates a new SBMLError to report that something occurred during SBML

any string passed in the argument C<details> to this constructor.  In
addition, all <a class="el"

the libSBML defaults for each different error identifier. @endif@~
If the error identifier C<errorId> is a number greater than 99999, the
SBMLError class assumes the error was generated from another part of
the software and does not do additional filling in of values beyond
the default in the constructor itself.  This allows SBMLError to serve
as a base class for other errors, such as for user-defined validation
rules (see Validator).  Callers should fill in all the parameters with
suitable values if generating errors with codes greater than 99999 to
make maximum use of the SBMLError facilities.

assigned based on the error code.  If the value of C<errorId> is a
value from <a class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t">SBMLErrorCode_t</a>,
callers do not need to fill in C<severity> and C<category>.
Conversely, if C<errorId> is not a value from <a class="el"

values (not just those from <a class="el"

href="#SBMLErrorCategory_t">SBMLErrorCategory_t</a>, but their own
special values) for C<severity> and

there are additional constants defined for <a class="el"

error in libSBML has an associated value for severity and category taken
from these predefined sets.  These constants have symbol names
prefixed with C<LIBSBML_SEV_> and C<LIBSBML_CAT_>,
respectively.  If the value of C<errorId> is one of the standard error
codes, callers do not need to fill in C<severity> and C<category> in a

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of MIRIAM-compliant controlled vocabulary
annotation.

@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
The SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 specifications define a simple
format for annotating models when (a) referring to controlled vocabulary
terms and database identifiers that define and describe biological and
biochemical entities, and (b) describing the creator of a model and the
model's modification history.  This SBML format is a concrete syntax that
conforms to the guidelines of MIRIAM (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n12/abs/nbt1156.html">"Minimum Information Requested in the Annotation of
biochemical Models"</a>, <i>Nature Biotechnology</i>, vol. 23, no. 12,
Dec. 2005).  The format uses a subset of W3C RDF (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Format</a>).  In order
to help application developers work with annotations in this format,
libSBML provides several helper classes that provide higher-level
interfaces to the data elements; these classes include CVTerm,
ModelCreator, ModelHistory, RDFAnnotationParser, and Date.
@section annotation-parts Components of an SBML annotation
The SBML annotation format consists of RDF-based content placed inside
an C<&lt;annotation&gt;> element attached to an SBML component
such as Species, Compartment, etc.  The following template illustrates
the different parts of SBML annotations in XML form:
<pre class="fragment">

&lt;/annotation&gt;
<span style="background-color: #d0eed0">+++</span>
&lt;/<span style="background-color: #bbb">SBML_ELEMENT</span>&gt;
</pre>

In the template above, the placeholder
<span class="code" style="background-color: #bbb">SBML_ELEMENT</span> stands for
the XML tag name of an SBML model component (e.g., C<model>,
C<reaction>, etc.) and the placeholder 
<span class="code" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black">meta id</span>
stands for the element's meta identifier, which is a field available
on all SBML components derived from the SBase base object class.
The <span style="border-bottom: 2px dotted #888">dotted</span>
portions are optional, the symbol
<span class="code" style="background-color: #d0eed0">+++</span> is a placeholder
for either no content or valid XML content that is not defined by
this annotation scheme, and the ellipses
<span class="code" style="background-color: #edd">...</span>
are placeholders for zero or more elements of the same form as the
immediately preceding element.  The optional content
<span class="code" style="background-color: #e0e0e0; border-bottom: 2px dotted #888">HISTORY</span>
is a creation and modification history; in libSBML, this is stored
using ModelHistory objects.
The placeholder <span class="code" style="background-color:
#bbb">RELATION_ELEMENT</span> refers to a BioModels.net qualifier element
name.  This is an element in either the XML namespace
C<"http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers"> (for model
qualifiers) or C<"http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers"> (for
biological qualifier).  Note that these namespace URIs are only labels,
and not actual Web locations, which means you cannot visit an address such
as C<"http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers"> in your browser or
try to have your application access it.  @if Refer instead to the enumerations
#ModelQualifierType_t and #BiolQualifierType_t for a list of the available
relationship elements that can be used for <span class="code"
style="background-color: #bbb">RELATION_ELEMENT</span>.@endif@~
The <span class="code" style="background-color: #d0d0ee">URI</span> is a
required data value that uniquely identifies a resource and data within
that resource to which the annotation refers.  Again, being URIs, these do
not refer to physical Web locations; nevertheless, applications will often
want a means of finding the resource to which a given <span class="code"
style="background-color: #d0d0ee">URI</span> refers.  Providing the
facilities for this task is the purpose of MIRIAM Resources, described in
detail online at <a target="_blank"
href="http://biomodels.net/miriam">http://biomodels.net/miriam</a>) and
also in the paper <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/1/58">"MIRIAM Resources: tools to generate and
resolve robust cross-references in Systems Biology"</a>, <i>BMC Systems
Biology</i>, 58(1), 2007.
The relation-resource pairs above are the "controlled vocabulary" terms
that which CVTerm is designed to store and manipulate.  The next section
describes these parts in more detail.  For more information about
SBML annotations in general, please refer to Section&nbsp;6 in the
SBML Level&nbsp;2 (Versions 2&ndash;4) or Level&nbsp;3 specification
documents.


@section cvterm-parts The parts of a CVTerm
Annotations that refer to controlled vocabularies are managed in libSBML
using CVTerm objects.  A set of RDF-based annotations attached to a
given SBML C<&lt;annotation&gt;> element are read by
RDFAnnotationParser and converted into a list of these CVTerm objects.
Each CVTerm object instance stores the following components of an
annotation:

\n=over\n
<li>The I<qualifier>, which can be a BioModels.net "biological
qualifier", a BioModels.net "model qualifier", or an unknown qualifier
(as far as the CVTerm class is concerned).  Qualifiers are used in
MIRIAM to indicate the nature of the relationship between the object
being annotated and the resource.  In CVTerm, the qualifiers can be
manipulated using the methods CVTerm::getQualifierType(),
CVTerm::setQualifierType(@if java int type@endif), and related methods.
<li>The I<resource>, represented by a URI (which, we must remind
developers, is not the same as a URL).  In the CVTerm class, the
resource component can be manipulated using the methods
CVTerm::addResource(@if java String resource@endif) and
CVTerm::removeResource(@if java String resource@endif).
\n=back\n

Note that a CVTerm contains a single qualifier, but possibly more than
one resource.  This corresponds to the possibility of an annotation that
points to multiple resources, all of which are qualified by the same
BioModels.net qualifier.  The CVTerm object class supports this by
supporting a list of resources.
Detailed explanations of the qualifiers defined by BioModels.net can be
found at <a target="_blank"
href="http://biomodels.net/qualifiers">http://biomodels.net/qualifiers</a>.

This method creates a CVTerm object from the given XMLNode object @p
node.  XMLNode is libSBML's representation of a node in an XML tree of
elements, and each such element can be placed in a namespace.  This
constructor looks for the element to be in the XML namespaces
C<"http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers"> (for
model qualifiers) and
C<"http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers"> (for
biological qualifier), and if they are, creates CVTerm objects for

identifying which one of these two relationship namespaces is being
used; any other qualifier in libSBML is considered unknown (as far as
the CVTerm class is concerned).  Consequently, this method will return
one of the following values:

=item CVTerm::addResource

Adds a resource reference to this CVTerm object.
C<opydetails> doc_what_are_cvterms 
The specific RDF element used in this SBML format for referring to
external entities is C<&lt;rdf:Description&gt;>, with a
C<&lt;rdf:Bag&gt;> element containing one or more
C<&lt;rdf:li&gt;> elements.  Each such element refers to a
data item in an external resource; the resource and data item are
together identified uniquely using a URI.  The following template
illustrates the structure:
<pre class="fragment">
&lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;#<span style="border-bottom: 1px solid black">meta id</span>&quot;&gt;
<span style="background-color: #e0e0e0; border-bottom: 2px dotted #888">HISTORY</span>

&lt;/<span style="background-color: #bbb">RELATION_ELEMENT</span>&gt;
<span style="background-color: #edd">...</span>
&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
</pre>
In the template above, the placeholder <span class="code"
style="border-bottom: 1px solid black">meta id</span> stands for the
element's meta identifier, which is a field available on all SBML
components derived from the SBase base object class.  The <span
style="border-bottom: 2px dotted #888">dotted</span> portions are
optional, and the ellipses <span class="code"
style="background-color: #edd">...</span> are placeholders for zero or
more elements of the same form as the immediately preceding element.
The placeholder <span class="code" style="background-color: #bbb">
RELATION_ELEMENT</span> refers to a BioModels.net qualifier element
name.  This is an element in either the XML namespace
C<"http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers"> (for model
qualifiers) or C<"http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers">
(for biological qualifier).
The <span class="code" style="background-color: #d0d0ee">resource
URI</span> is a required data value that uniquely identifies a
resource and data within that resource to which the annotation refers.
The present method allows callers to add a reference to a resource URI
with the same relationship to the enclosing SBML object.  (In other
words, the argument to this method is a <span class="code"
style="background-color: #d0d0ee">resource URI</span> as shown in the
XML fragment above.)  Resources are stored in this CVTerm object
within an XMLAttributes object.
The relationship of this CVTerm to the enclosing SBML object can be
determined using the CVTerm methods such as getModelQualifierType()
and getBiologicalQualifierType().
@param resource a string representing the URI of the resource and data
item being referenced; e.g.,
C<"http://www.geneontology.org/#GO:0005892">.

@return integer value indicating success/failure of the call. The

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of MIRIAM-compliant dates used in
ModelHistory.

@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
A Date object stores a reasonably complete representation of date and
time.  Its purpose is to serve as a way to store dates to be read and
written in the <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">W3C date format</a> used in
RDF Dublin Core annotations within SBML.  The W3C date format is a
restricted form of <a target="_blank"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a>, the
international standard for the representation of dates and times.  A
time and date value in this W3C format takes the form
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssXHH:ZZ (e.g., C<1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00>)
where XHH:ZZ is the time zone offset.  The libSBML Date object contains
the following fields to represent these values:
@li I<year>: an unsigned int representing the year.  This should be a
four-digit number such as C<2011>.
@li I<month>: an unsigned int representing the month, with a range of
values of 1&ndash;12.  The value C<1> represents January, and so on.
@li I<day>: an unsigned int representing the day of the month, with a
range of values of 1&ndash;31.
@li I<hour>: an unsigned int representing the hour on a 24-hour clock,
with a range of values of 0&ndash;23.
@li I<minute>: an unsigned int representing the minute, with a range
of 0&ndash;59.
@li I<second>: an unsigned int representing the second, with a range
of 0&ndash;59.
@li I<sign>: an unsigned int representing the sign of the offset (C<0>
signifying C<+> and C<1> signifying C<->).  See the paragraph below for
further explanations.
@li I<hours> offset: an unsigned int representing the time zone's hour
offset from GMT.
@li I<minute> offset: an unsigned int representing the time zone's
minute offset from GMT.
To illustrate the time zone offset, a value of C<-05:00> would
correspond to USA Eastern Standard Time.  In the Date object, this would
require a value of C<1> for the sign field, C<5> for the hour offset and
C<0> for the minutes offset.
In the restricted RDF annotations used in SBML, described in
Section&nbsp;6 of the SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 specification
documents, date/time stamps can be used to indicate the time of
creation and modification of a model.  The following SBML model fragment
illustrates this:

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of MIRIAM-compliant model creator data
used in ModelHistory.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
The SBML specification beginning with Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2
defines a standard approach to recording model history and model creator
information in a form that complies with MIRIAM ("Minimum Information
Requested in the Annotation of biochemical Models", <i>Nature
Biotechnology</i>, vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2005).  For the model creator,
this form involves the use of parts of the <a target="_blank"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">vCard</a> representation.
LibSBML provides the ModelCreator class as a convenience high-level
interface for working with model creator data.  Objects of class
ModelCreator can be used to store and carry around creator data within a
program, and the various methods in this object class let callers
manipulate the different parts of the model creator representation.
@section parts The different parts of a model creator definition
The ModelCreator class mirrors the structure of the MIRIAM model creator
annotations in SBML.  The following template illustrates these different
fields when they are written in XML form:
<pre class="fragment">

=head2 ModelHistory

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of MIRIAM-compliant model history data.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
The SBML specification beginning with Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2 defines
a standard approach to recording optional model history and model creator
information in a form that complies with MIRIAM (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n12/abs/nbt1156.html">"Minimum
Information Requested in the Annotation of biochemical Models"</a>,
<i>Nature Biotechnology</i>, vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2005).  LibSBML
provides the ModelHistory class as a convenient high-level interface for
working with model history data.
Model histories in SBML consist of one or more <em>model creators</em>,
a single date of I<creation>, and one or more I<modification> dates.
The overall XML form of this data takes the following form:
<pre class="fragment">

&lt;/dcterms:modified&gt;
<span style="background-color: #edd">...</span>
</pre>

In the template above, the <span style="border-bottom: 2px dotted #888">underlined</span>
portions are optional, the symbol
<span class="code" style="background-color: #d0eed0">+++</span> is a placeholder
for either no content or valid XML content that is not defined by
the annotation scheme, and the ellipses
<span class="code" style="background-color: #edd">...</span>
are placeholders for zero or more elements of the same form as the
immediately preceding element.  The various placeholders for content, namely
<span class="code" style="background-color: #bbb">family name</span>,
<span class="code" style="background-color: #bbb">given name</span>,
<span class="code" style="background-color: #bbb">email address</span>,

=head2 RDFAnnotationParser

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Read/write/manipulate RDF annotations stored in SBML
annotation elements.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
RDFAnnotationParser is a libSBML construct used as part of the libSBML
support for annotations conforming to the guidelines specified by MIRIAM
(<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n12/abs/nbt1156.html">"Minimum
Information Requested in the Annotation of biochemical Models"</a>,
<i>Nature Biotechnology</i>, vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2005).  Section 6 of
the SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 specification documents defines a
recommended way of encoding MIRIAM information using a subset of RDF (<a
target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description
Format</a>).  The general scheme is as follows.  A set of RDF-based
annotations attached to a given SBML C<&lt;annotation&gt;>
element are read by RDFAnnotationParser and converted into a list of
CVTerm objects.  There are different versions of the main method, @if clike RDFAnnotationParser::parseRDFAnnotation(const XMLNode  annotation, List  CVTerms) @endif@if java RDFAnnotationParser::parseRDFAnnotation(const XMLNode  annotation, CVTermList  CVTerms) @endif@~ and
RDFAnnotationParser::parseRDFAnnotation(const XMLNode  annotation), used
depending on whether the annotation in question concerns the MIRIAM model
history or other MIRIAM resource annotations.  A special object class,
ModelHistory, is used to make it easier to manipulate model history
annotations.

All of the methods on RDFAnnotationParser are static; the class exists
only to encapsulate the annotation and CVTerm parsing and manipulation
functionality.

=item RDFAnnotationParser::parseRDFAnnotation

Takes an SBML object and creates an empty XMLNode corresponding to an

This method is a handy way of creating RDF description objects linked
by the appropriate "metaid" field to the given C<object>, for
insertion into RDF annotations in a model.  The method retrieves the
"metaid" attribute from the C<object> passed in as argument, then
creates an empty element having the following form
(where <span class="code" style="background-color: #eed0d0">metaid</span> 
the value of the "metaid" attribute of the argument):

=head2 SBaseExtensionPoint

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of an extension point of SBML's package
extension.

SBaseExtensionPoint represents an element to be extended (extension point) and the
extension point is identified by a combination of a package name and a typecode of the 
element.

<p>
For example, an SBaseExtensionPoint object which represents an extension point of the model
element defined in the <em>core</em> package can be created as follows:
@verbatim
SBaseExtensionPoint  modelextp("core", SBML_MODEL);
@endverbatim
Similarly, an SBaseExtensionPoint object which represents an extension point of
the layout element defined in the layout extension can be created as follows:
@verbatim
SBaseExtensionPoint  layoutextp("layout", SBML_LAYOUT_LAYOUT);
@endverbatim
SBaseExtensionPoint object is required as one of arguments of the constructor 
of SBasePluginCreator&lt;class SBasePluginType, class SBMLExtensionType&gt;
template class to identify an extension poitnt to which the plugin object created
by the creator class is plugged in.
For example, the SBasePluginCreator class which creates a LayoutModelPlugin object
of the layout extension which is plugged in to the model element of the <em>core</em>
package can be created with the corresponding SBaseExtensionPoint object as follows:
@verbatim
// std::vector object that contains a list of URI (package versions) supported 
// by the plugin object.
std::vector<std::string> packageURIs;
packageURIs.push_back(getXmlnsL3V1V1());
packageURIs.push_back(getXmlnsL2());  
// creates an extension point (model element of the "core" package)
SBaseExtensionPoint  modelExtPoint("core",SBML_MODEL);
// creates an SBasePluginCreator object 
SBasePluginCreator<LayoutModelPlugin, LayoutExtension>  modelPluginCreator(modelExtPoint,packageURIs);
@endverbatim
This kind of code is implemented in init() function of each SBMLExtension derived classes.

=head2 SBasePlugin

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html Representation of a plug-in object of SBML's package
extension.

Additional attributes and/or elements of a package extension which are directly 
contained by some pre-defined element are contained/accessed by <a href="#SBasePlugin"> 
SBasePlugin </a> class which is extended by package developers for each extension point.
The extension point, which represents an element to be extended, is identified by a 
combination of a Package name and a typecode of the element, and is represented by
SBaseExtensionPoint class.
</p>

<p>
For example, the layout extension defines <em>&lt;listOfLayouts&gt;</em> element which is 
directly contained in <em>&lt;model&gt;</em> element of the core package. 
In the layout package (provided as one of example packages in libSBML-5), the additional 
element for the model element is implemented as ListOfLayouts class (an SBase derived class) and 
the object is contained/accessed by a LayoutModelPlugin class (an SBasePlugin derived class). 
</p>

<p>
SBasePlugin class defines basic virtual functions for reading/writing/checking 
additional attributes and/or top-level elements which should or must be overridden by 
subclasses like SBase class and its derived classes.
</p>

<p>
Package developers must implement an SBasePlugin exntended class for 
each element to be extended (e.g. SBMLDocument, Model, ...) in which additional 
attributes and/or top-level elements of the package extension are directly contained.
</p>

To implement reading/writing functions for attributes and/or top-level 
elements of the SBsaePlugin extended class, package developers should or must
override the corresponding virtual functions below provided in the SBasePlugin class:
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\n<p>reading elements : </p>
<ol>
\n=item\n\nC<virtual SBase  createObject (XMLInputStream& stream) >
<p>This function must be overridden if one or more additional elements are defined.</p>
</li>
\n=item\n\nC<virtual bool readOtherXML (SBase  parentObject, XMLInputStream& stream)>
<p>This function should be overridden if elements of annotation, notes, MathML, etc. need 
to be directly parsed from the given XMLInputStream object @if clike instead of the
SBase::readAnnotation(XMLInputStream& stream)
and/or SBase::readNotes(XMLInputStream& stream) functions@endif.
</p> 
</li>
</ol>
</li>
\n=item\n\n<p>reading attributes (must be overridden if additional attributes are defined) :</p>
<ol>
<li>C<virtual void addExpectedAttributes(ExpectedAttributes& attributes) ></li>
<li>C<virtual void readAttributes (const XMLAttributes& attributes, const ExpectedAttributes& expectedAttributes)></li>
</ol>
</li>
\n=item\n\n<p>writing elements (must be overridden if additional elements are defined) :</p>
<ol>

</ol>
</li>
\n=item\n\n<p>writing attributes : </p>
<ol>
<li>C<virtual void writeAttributes (XMLOutputStream& stream) const >
<p>This function must be overridden if one or more additional attributes are defined.</p>
</li>
<li>C<virtual void writeXMLNS (XMLOutputStream& stream) const >
<p>This function must be overridden if one or more additional xmlns attributes are defined.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

\n=item\n\n<p>checking elements (should be overridden) :</p>
<ol>
<li>C<virtual bool hasRequiredElements() const ></li>
</ol>
</li>
\n=item\n\n<p>checking attributes (should be overridden) :</p>
<ol>
<li>C<virtual bool hasRequiredAttributes() const ></li>
</ol>
</li>
\n=back\n

<p>
To implement package-specific creating/getting/manipulating functions of the
SBasePlugin derived class (e.g., getListOfLayouts(), createLyout(), getLayout(),
and etc are implemented in LayoutModelPlugin class of the layout package), package
developers must newly implement such functions (as they like) in the derived class.
</p>

<p>
SBasePlugin class defines other virtual functions of internal implementations
such as:
\n=over\n
<li>C< virtual void setSBMLDocument(SBMLDocument  d) >
<li>C< virtual void connectToParent(SBase  sbase) >
<li>C< virtual void enablePackageInternal(const std::string& pkgURI, const std::string& pkgPrefix, bool flag) >
\n=back\n

These functions must be overridden by subclasses in which one or more top-level elements are defined.
</p>

<p>
For example, the following three SBasePlugin extended classes are implemented in
the layout extension:
</p>

<ol>
\n=item\n\n<p><a href="class_s_b_m_l_document_plugin.html"> SBMLDocumentPlugin </a> class for SBMLDocument element</p>
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\n<em> required </em> attribute is added to SBMLDocument object.
</li>
\n=back\n
<p>
(<a href="class_s_b_m_l_document_plugin.html"> SBMLDocumentPlugin </a> class is a common SBasePlugin 
extended class for SBMLDocument class. Package developers can use this class as-is if no additional 
elements/attributes (except for <em> required </em> attribute) is needed for the SBMLDocument class 
in their packages, otherwise package developers must implement a new SBMLDocumentPlugin derived class.)
</p>

\n=item\n\n<p>LayoutModelPlugin class for Model element</p>

\n=item\n\n&lt;listOfLayouts&gt; element is added to Model object.

@sbmlpackage{core}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html The core component of SBML's package extension.
SBMLExtension class (abstract class) is a core component of package extension
which needs to be extended by package developers. 
The class provides functions for getting common attributes of package extension 
(e.g., package name, package version, and etc.), functions for adding (registering) 
each instantiated SBasePluginCreator object, and a static function (defined in each 
SBMLExtension extended class) for initializing/registering the package extension 
when the library of the package is loaded.
@section howto How to implement an SBMLExtension extended class for each package extension
Package developers must implement an SBMLExtension extended class for
their packages (e.g. GroupsExtension class is implemented for groups extension).
The extended class is implemented based on the following steps:
(NOTE: 
"src/packages/groups/extension/GroupsExtension.{h,cpp}" and
"src/packages/layout/extension/LayoutExtension.{h,cpp}" are
example files in which SBMLExtension derived classes are implemented)
<ol>

\n=item\n\nDefine the following static functions in the extended class:
(examples of groups extension are shown respectively)
<ol>
\n=item\n\n<p>A string of package name (label) (The function name must be "getPackageName".)</p>
@verbatim
const std::string& GroupsExtension::getPackageName ()
{
static const std::string pkgName = "groups";
return pkgName;
}
@endverbatim
</li>

\n=item\n\n<p>
Methods returning an integer of Default SBML level, version, and package version
(The method names must be "getDefaultLevel()", "getDefaultVersion()", and 
"getDefaultPackageVersion()" respectively.)
</p>
@verbatim
unsigned int GroupsExtension::getDefaultLevel()
{
return 3;
}  
unsigned int GroupsExtension::getDefaultVersion()
{
return 1; 
}
unsigned int GroupsExtension::getDefaultPackageVersion()
{
return 1;
}  
@endverbatim
</li>
\n=item\n\n<p> Methods returning Strings that represent the URI of packages </p>
@verbatim
const std::string& GroupsExtension::getXmlnsL3V1V1 ()
{
static const std::string xmlns = "http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/groups/version1";
return xmlns;
}
@endverbatim 
</li>
\n=item\n\n<p>Strings that represent the other URI needed in this package (if any) </p>
</li>
</ol> 
</li>

\n=item\n\nOverride the following pure virtual functions
\n=over\n
\n=item\n\nC<virtual const std::string& getName () const =0>. This function returns the name of the package (e.g., "layout", "groups"). </li>
\n=item\n\nC<virtual unsigned int getLevel (const std::string &uri) const =0>. This function returns the SBML level with the given URI of this package. </li>
\n=item\n\nC<virtual unsigned int getVersion (const std::string &uri) const =0>. This function returns the SBML version with the given URI of this package. </li>
\n=item\n\nC<virtual unsigned int getPackageVersion (const std::string &uri) const =0>. This function returns the package version with the given URI of this package.</li>
\n=item\n\nC<virtual unsigned int getURI (unsigned int sbmlLevel, unsigned int sbmlVersion, unsigned int pkgVersion) const =0>. 
This function returns the URI (namespace) of the package corresponding to the combination of the given sbml level, sbml version, and pacakege version</li>
\n=item\n\nC<virtual SBMLExtension  clone () const = 0>. This function creates and returns a deep copy of this derived object.</li>
\n=back\n
<p>For example, the above functions are overridden in the groups
package ("src/packages/groups/extension/GroupsExtension.cpp") as follows:</p>
@verbatim
const std::string&
GroupsExtension::getName() const
{
return getPackageName();
}
unsigned int 
GroupsExtension::getLevel(const std::string &uri) const
{
if (uri == getXmlnsL3V1V1())
{
return 3;
}

return 0;
}
unsigned int 
GroupsExtension::getVersion(const std::string &uri) const
{
if (uri == getXmlnsL3V1V1())
{
return 1;
}

return 0;
}
unsigned int
GroupsExtension::getPackageVersion(const std::string &uri) const
{
if (uri == getXmlnsL3V1V1())
{
return 1;
}

return 0;
}
const std::string& 
GroupsExtension::getURI(unsigned int sbmlLevel, unsigned int sbmlVersion, unsigned int pkgVersion) const
{
if (sbmlLevel == 3)
{
if (sbmlVersion == 1)
{
if (pkgVersion == 1)
{
return getXmlnsL3V1V1();
}
}
}

static std::string empty = "";
return empty;
}
GroupsExtension  
GroupsExtension::clone () const
{
return new GroupsExtension( this);  
}
@endverbatim
Constructor, copy Constructor, and destructor also must be overridden
if additional data members are defined in the derived class.
</li>

\n=item\n\n<p>
Define typedef and template instantiation code for the package specific SBMLExtensionNamespaces template class
</p>

<ol>
\n=item\n\ntypedef for the package specific SBMLExtensionNamespaces template class
<p> For example, the typedef for GroupsExtension (defined in the groups package) is implemented in GroupsExtension.h as follows:</p>
@verbatim
// GroupsPkgNamespaces is derived from the SBMLNamespaces class and used when creating an object of 
// SBase derived classes defined in groups package.
typedef SBMLExtensionNamespaces<GroupsExtension> GroupsPkgNamespaces;
@endverbatim
</li>

\n=item\n\ntemplate instantiation code for the above typedef definition in the implementation file (i.e.,  .cpp file).
<p> For example, the template instantiation code for GroupsExtension is implemented in GroupsExtension.cpp 
as follows:
</p>

@verbatim
// Instantiate SBMLExtensionNamespaces<GroupsExtension> (GroupsPkgNamespaces) for DLL.
template class LIBSBML_EXTERN SBMLExtensionNamespaces<GroupsExtension>;
@endverbatim
</li>
</ol>
<p> The SBMLExtensionNamespaces template class is a derived class of
SBMLNamespaces and can be used as an argument of constructors 
of SBase derived classes defined in the package extensions.
For example, a GroupsPkgNamespaces object can be used when creating a group 
object as follows:
</P>
@verbatim
GroupPkgNamespaces gpns(3,1,1);  // The arguments are SBML Level, SBML Version, and Groups Package Version.
Group g = new Group(&gpns);      // Creates a group object of L3V1 Groups V1.
@endverbatim
<p>
Also, the GroupsPkgNamespaces object can be used when creating an
SBMLDocument object with the groups package as follows:
</p>

@verbatim
GroupsPkgNamespaces gpns(3,1,1);
SBMLDocument  doc;
doc  = new SBMLDocument(&gnps); // Creates an SBMLDocument of L3V1 with Groups V1.
@endverbatim
</li>

\n=item\n\nOverride the following pure virtual function which returns the SBMLNamespaces derived object 
@verbatim
virtual SBMLNamespaces  getSBMLExtensionNamespaces (const std::string &uri) const =0
@endverbatim
<p> For example, the function is overridden in GroupsExtension
class as follows:</p>
@verbatim
SBMLNamespaces 
GroupsExtension::getSBMLExtensionNamespaces(const std::string &uri) const
{
GroupsPkgNamespaces  pkgns = NULL;
if ( uri == getXmlnsL3V1V1())
{
pkgns = new GroupsPkgNamespaces(3,1,1);    
}  
return pkgns;
}
@endverbatim
</li>


\n=item\n\nDefine an enum type for representing the typecode of elements (SBase extended classes) defined in the package extension
<p>  For example, SBMLGroupsTypeCode_t for groups package is
defined in GroupsExtension.h as follows: </p>
@verbatim
typedef enum
{
SBML_GROUPS_GROUP  = 200
, SBML_GROUPS_MEMBER = 201
} SBMLGroupsTypeCode_t;
@endverbatim    
<p> <em>SBML_GROUPS_GROUP</em> corresponds to the Group class (&lt;group&gt;)
and <em>SBML_GROUPS_MEMBER</em> corresponds to the Member (&lt;member&gt;) class, respectively.
<p> Similarly, #SBMLLayoutTypeCode_t 
for layout package is defined in LayoutExtension.h as follows: </p>
@verbatim  
typedef enum
{
SBML_LAYOUT_BOUNDINGBOX           = 100
, SBML_LAYOUT_COMPARTMENTGLYPH      = 101
, SBML_LAYOUT_CUBICBEZIER           = 102
, SBML_LAYOUT_CURVE                 = 103
, SBML_LAYOUT_DIMENSIONS            = 104
, SBML_LAYOUT_GRAPHICALOBJECT       = 105
, SBML_LAYOUT_LAYOUT                = 106   
, SBML_LAYOUT_LINESEGMENT           = 107   
, SBML_LAYOUT_POINT                 = 108    
, SBML_LAYOUT_REACTIONGLYPH         = 109    
, SBML_LAYOUT_SPECIESGLYPH          = 110    
, SBML_LAYOUT_SPECIESREFERENCEGLYPH = 111
, SBML_LAYOUT_TEXTGLYPH             = 112
} SBMLLayoutTypeCode_t;
@endverbatim
<p>
These enum values are returned by corresponding getTypeCode() functions.
(e.g. SBML_GROUPS_GROUP is returned in Group::getTypeCode())
</p>

<p>
The value of each typecode can be duplicated between those of different 
packages (In the above SBMLayoutTypeCode_t and SBMLGroupsTypeCode_t types, 
unique values are assigned to enum values, but this is not mandatory.)
</p>

<p>
Thus, to distinguish the typecodes of different packages, not only the return
value of getTypeCode() function but also that of getPackageName()
function should be checked as follows:
</p>
@verbatim
void example (const SBase  sb)
{
const std::string pkgName = sb->getPackageName();
if (pkgName == "core") {
switch (sb->getTypeCode()) {
case SBML_MODEL:
....
break;
case SBML_REACTION:
....
}
} 
else if (pkgName == "layout") {
switch (sb->getTypeCode()) {
case SBML_LAYOUT_LAYOUT:
....
break;
case SBML_LAYOUT_REACTIONGLYPH:
....
}
} 
else if (pkgName == "groups") {
switch (sb->getTypeCode()) {
case SBML_GROUPS_GROUP:
....
break;
case SBML_GROUPS_MEMBER:
....
}
}
...
} 
@endverbatim
</li>
\n=item\n\nOverride the following pure virtual function which returns a string corresponding to the given typecode:
@verbatim  
virtual const char  SBMLExtension::getStringFromTypeCode(int typeCode) const;
@endverbatim 
<p> For example, the function for groups extension is implemented as follows: </p>
@verbatim  
static
const char  SBML_GROUPS_TYPECODE_STRINGS[] =
{
"Group"
, "Member"
};
const char  
GroupsExtension::getStringFromTypeCode(int typeCode) const
{
int min = SBML_GROUPS_GROUP;
int max = SBML_GROUPS_MEMBER;
if ( typeCode E<lt> min || typeCode E<gt> max)
{
return "(Unknown SBML Groups Type)";  
}

return SBML_GROUPS_TYPECODE_STRINGS[typeCode - min];
}
@endverbatim 
</li>

\n=item\n\nImplements a "static void init()" function in the derived class
<p> In the init() function, initialization code which creates an instance of 
the derived class and registering code which registers the instance to 
SBMLExtensionRegistry class are implemented.
</p>

For example, the init() function for groups package is implemented as follows: 
@verbatim
void 
GroupsExtension::init()
{
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// 1. Checks if the groups package has already been registered.
//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
if ( SBMLExtensionRegistry::getInstance().isRegistered(getPackageName()) )
{
// do nothing;
return;
}
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// 2. Creates an SBMLExtension derived object.
//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
GroupsExtension groupsExtension;
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// 3. Creates SBasePluginCreatorBase derived objects required for this 
//    extension. The derived classes can be instantiated by using the following 
//     template class.
//
//    temaplate<class SBasePluginType> class SBasePluginCreator
//
//    The constructor of the creator class has two arguments:
//
//        (1) SBaseExtensionPoint : extension point to which the plugin object connected
//        (2) std::vector<std::string> : a std::vector object that contains a list of URI
//                                       (package versions) supported by the plugin object.
//
//    For example, two plugin objects (plugged in SBMLDocument and Model elements) are 
//    required for the groups extension.
//
//    Since only 'required' attribute is used in SBMLDocument by the groups package, and
//    the 'required' flag must always be 'false', the existing
//    SBMLDocumentPluginNotRequired class can be used as-is for the plugin.
//
//    Since the lists of supported package versions (currently only L3V1-groups-V1 supported )
//    are equal in the both plugin objects, the same vector object is given to each 
//    constructor.
//
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
std::vector<std::string> packageURIs;
packageURIs.push_back(getXmlnsL3V1V1());

SBaseExtensionPoint sbmldocExtPoint("core",SBML_DOCUMENT);
SBaseExtensionPoint modelExtPoint("core",SBML_MODEL);
SBasePluginCreator<SBMLDocumentPluginNotRequired, GroupsExtension> sbmldocPluginCreator(sbmldocExtPoint,packageURIs);
SBasePluginCreator<GroupsModelPlugin,   GroupsExtension> modelPluginCreator(modelExtPoint,packageURIs);
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// 3. Adds the above SBasePluginCreatorBase derived objects to the SBMLExtension derived object.
//
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
groupsExtension.addSBasePluginCreator(&sbmldocPluginCreator);
groupsExtension.addSBasePluginCreator(&modelPluginCreator);
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// 4. Registers the SBMLExtension derived object to SBMLExtensionRegistry
//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
int result = SBMLExtensionRegistry::getInstance().addExtension(&groupsExtension);
if (result != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS)
{
std::cerr << "[Error] GroupsExtension::init() failed." << std::endl;
}
}
@endverbatim
</p> 
</li>
\n=item\n\nInstantiate a global SBMLExtensionRegister variable in appropriate 
implementation file
<p> For example, the global variable for the groups extension is instantiated in GroupsExtension.cpp as follows: </p>
@verbatim
static SBMLExtensionRegister<GroupsExtension> groupsExtensionRegister;
@endverbatim
The init() function is invoked when the global variable is instantiated,
by which initialization and registering the package extension are performed.

@sbmlpackage{comp}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-comp.html Implementation of the &ldquo;comp&rdquo; package
extention to the SBase construct.
The CompSBasePlugin class inherits from the SBasePlugin class, 
and codifies the extentions to the SBase class defined in the
@ref comp @if java "Hierarchical Model Composition"@endif@~ 
package (&ldquo;comp&rdquo;).  This extention allows the modeler to define
one or more submodel elements which the parent SBase object replaces,
and/or a single submodel element which replaces the parent SBase object.
This is accomplished through the addition of an optional ListOfReplacedElements
child, which may contain one or more ReplacedElement objects, each of which 
references a submodel object to be replaced by the containing SBase object, 
and through the addition of a single optional ReplacedBy child, which 
references a submodel object which is to replace the containing SBase object.
If a single SBase element both contains a ListOfReplacedElements and has a ReplacedBy
child, it and all the referenced ReplacedElement objects are to be replaced
by the object referenced by the ReplacedBy element.

=item CompSBMLDocumentPlugin::getSBMLDocumentFromURI

Uses the suite of URI resolvers to find the document referenced by the
URI, or C<NULL> if no document can be found.  The pointer returned is a
non-owning  pointer: this CompSBMLDocumentPlugin owns the document in
question, and will return the same pointer if the same URI is requested
later.  This is so that when Model  objects are returned by
ExternalModelDefinition functions, the document the model is from will
persist.  The public interface for this function is therefore to use
ExternalModelDefinition::getReferencedModel() function.


=item CompSBMLDocumentPlugin::getResolvedURI

Used by getSBMDocumentFromURI to first resolve the URI into its
canonical form, for example, from 'model.xml" to
"file:/path/to/model.xml".


=item CompSBMLDocumentPlugin::clearStoredURIDocuments

Clears the internal list of SBMLDocuments kept when resolving URIs.  May
invalidate distributed pointers, and therefore should only be used if a
call to getSBMLDocumentFromURI has returned an incorrect document, and
the URI resolvers have since been tweaked so as to no longer return the

Returns the host portion of the stored URI.
For a scheme such as C<"http">, this method returns the part of the URI
after C<"http>://" and before the next C<">/" character.  URIs with file

string.

@return the host of the URI, or an empty string in the case of files
or URNs schemes that do not possess a host portion.


=item SBMLUri::getPath

Returns the path and filename portion of the stored URI.
This method returns the text after the scheme, colon, and host (if
present), and before the next C<"?"> character.  The result may be an
empty string for some URIs.
@return the path of the URI (i.e., the full filename with path)


=item SBMLUri::getQuery

Returns the query portion of the stored URI.
The equery portion of a URI is the text after a filename, starting with

The SBMLResolver class is the base class for the various SBML @em
resolvers: facilities that take a unique identifier as input and return
the document associated with that identifier.  In SBML, resolvers come
into play with the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Hierarchical Model Composition
package; this package includes features that allow a model to be composed
from pieces that are external to a given SBML document, which implies the
need to be able to identify and locate those external pieces.  The
SBMLResolver class and its subclasses provide facilities for software
applications to be able to do these tasks.
LibSBML provides a number of built-in resolvers, and applications can
create their own by subclassing SBMLResolver and following the examples
of the existing resolvers.  The following are the built-in resolvers
in libSBML @htmlinclude libsbml-version.html:
@li SBMLFileResolver
More resolvers may be provided by libSBML in the future.  Application

=head2 SBaseRef

@sbmlpackage{comp}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-comp.html Implementation of the SBaseRef construct from the
&ldquo;comp&rdquo; package.
The SBaseRef class was introduced by the SBML Level&nbsp;3 @ref comp
@if java "Hierarchical Model Composition"@endif@~ package
(&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) as the principle way by which submodel elements may
be referenced.  The SBaseRef class is usually found as the base class of a
Port, Deletion, ReplacedElement, or ReplacedBy class, but may appear as an
child of one of the above classes if the parent object references a
Submodel.

An SBaseRef object must reference an element using exactly one of the
optional attributes of the class.  Subclasses of SBaseRef may define
additional optional attributes that are legal ways to reference an element.
SBaseRef objects may reference elements that do not live in the Model parent 
of the SBaseRef object.  However, the SBaseRef class itself does not 
provide a method of determining which Model or Submodel is being referenced.
The subclasses of SBaseRef provide methods for this instead.
Once the Model to which the SBaseRef object is referencing has been established,
there are four optional attributes defined in the SBaseRef class that
are each methods of referencing an element:
@li "portRef" (type PortSIdRef):  As its name implies, this attribute is used to
refer to a port identifier, in the case when the reference being
constructed with the SBaseRef is intended to refer to a port on a
submodel.  The namespace of the PortSIdRef value is the set
of identifiers of type PortSId defined in the submodel, not
the parent model.
@li "idRef" (type SIdRef): As its name implies, this attribute is used to
refer to a regular identifier (i.e., the value of an "id"
attribute on some other object), in the case when the reference being
constructed with the SBaseRef is intended to refer to an object that
does not have a port identifier.  The namespace of the SIdRef
value is the set of identifiers of type SId defined in the
submodel, not the parent model.
@li "unitRef" (type UnitSIdRef): This attribute is used to refer to the identifier
of a UnitDefinition object.  The namespace of the UnitSIdRef
value is the set of unit identifiers defined in the submodel, not the
parent model. (Note that even though this attribute is of type UnitSIdRef,
the reserved unit identifiers that are defined by SBML Level 3 (see
Section 3.1.10 of the core specification) are
not  permitted as values of "unitRef".  Reserved unit
identifiers may not be replaced or deleted.)
@li "metaIdRef" (type IDREF): This attribute is used to refer to a "metaid"
attribute value on some other object, in the case when the reference
being constructed with the SBaseRef is intended to refer to an object
that does not have a port identifier.  The namespace of the "metaIdRef"
value is the entire document in which the referenced model resides, but
must refer to a subelement of the referenced model.  Since meta identifiers are
optional attributes of SBase, all SBML objects have the potential to
have a meta identifier value.
An SBaseRef object may have up to one subcomponent named "sBaseRef", of
type SBaseRef.  This permits recursive structures to be constructed so
that objects inside submodels can be referenced.
The form of such recursive references must be as follows.  The
highest-level SBaseRef object of such a chain (which will necessarily
be an object of class Port, Deletion, ReplacedElement or ReplacedBy,
because they are the only classes derived from the class SBaseRef) must
refer to a Submodel object in the containing model.  All child
SBaseRef objects in the chain must refer to components inside the
Model instance to which the Submodel refers.

Sets this SBML object to child SBML objects (if any).
(Creates a child-parent relationship by the parent)
Subclasses must override this function if they define
one ore more child elements.
Basically, this function needs to be called in
constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator.
@see setSBMLDocument

Examines the referenced Model for the referenced object, and returns it, if found.
@param model the Model in which to look for the object referenced by
this SBaseRef.

DEPRECATED FUNCTION:  DO NOT USE
Deletes the referenced object,

Get the  direct  referenced object, which might be a Port.


=item SBaseRef::collectDeletions

Collects (in 'toremove') the referenced object,
plus any other elements that element points to through ReplacedElement
or ReplacedBy children.  Does not delete the object directly; this should
be done carefully to avoid double-deletions or misinterpretation of 
nested replacements/deletions.  Any element already in 'removed' will
not be added to 'toremove', nor will its children be checked.

=head2 Replacing

@sbmlpackage{comp}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-comp.html A convenience subclass of the ReplacedElement and
ReplacedBy constructs from the &ldquo;comp&rdquo; package.
The Replacing class does not exist officialy in the the @ref comp
@if java "Hierarchical Model Composition"@endif@~ package
(&ldquo;comp&rdquo;), but is implemented here as a convenience subclass of
the ReplacedElement and ReplacedBy classes, since both of those classes
define a 'submodelRef' attribute.
The required attribute "submodelRef" takes a value of type
SIdRef, which must be the identifier of a Submodel object in
the containing model.  The model referenced by the
Submodel object establishes the object namespaces for the
"portRef", "idRef", "unitRef" and "metaIdRef"
attributes: only objects within the Model object may be referenced by
those attributes.

DEPRECATED FUNCTION:  DO NOT USE
To retain old functionality, this function calls performReplacementAndCollect,
and then actually removes the now-redundant element.  However, this can lead
to doubly-deleted elements, as well as the incorrect interpretation of some
models.  The replacement function performReplacementAndCollect
has been marked protected, in the hopes that people will instead simply
use CompModelPlugin::instantiateSubmodels, which hides all the complexity while
still allowing access to a non-flattened version of a hierarchical model.

=head2 Deletion

@sbmlpackage{comp}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-comp.html Implementation of the Deletion construct from the
&ldquo;comp&rdquo; package.
The Deletion class was introduced by the SBML Level&nbsp;3 @ref comp
@if java "Hierarchical Model Composition"@endif@~ package
(&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) to allow elements of submodels to be removed before
instantiation.

The Deletion object class is used to define a deletion operation
to be applied when a submodel instantiates a model definition.
Deletions may be useful in hierarchical model composition scenarios for
various reasons.  For example, some components in a submodel may be
redundant in the composed model, perhaps because the same features are
implemented in a different way in the new model.
Deletions function as follows.  When the Model to which the Submodel
object refers (via the "modelRef" attribute) is read and processed for
inclusion into the composed model, each Deletion object identifies an
object to remove from that Model instance.  The resulting submodel
instance consists of everything in the Model object instance minus the
entities referenced by the list of Deletion objects.
As might be expected, deletions can have wide-ranging implications,
especially when the object deleted has substantial substructure, as in
the case of reactions.  The following are rules regarding deletions and
their effects.
@li An object that has been deleted is considered inaccessible.
Any element that has been deleted (or replaced)
may not be referenced by an SBaseRef object.
@li If the deleted object has child objects and other structures, the
child objects and substructure are also considered to be deleted.
@li It is not an error to delete explicitly an object that is already
deleted by implication (for example as a result of the second point
above).  The resulting model is the same.
@li If the deleted object is from an SBML namespace that is not
understood by the interpreter, the deletion must be ignored&mdash;the 
object will not need to be deleted, as the interpreter could not
understand the package.  If an interpreter cannot tell whether 
a referenced object does not exist or if exists in an unparsed namespace
it may produce a warning.
The Deletion object class is subclassed from SBaseRef, and reuses all the 
machinery provided by SBaseRef.  In addition, it defines two optional 
attributes, "id" and "name".  The "id" attribute can be used to give an
identifier to a given deletion operation.  The identifier has no
mathematical meaning, but it may be useful for creating submodels that
can be manipulated more directly by other submodels.  (Indeed, it is
legitimate for an enclosing model definition to delete a deletion!)
The optional "name" attribute is provided on Deletion for the
same reason it is provided on other elements that have identifiers;
viz., to provide for the possibility of giving a human-readable name to
the object.  The name may be useful in situations when deletions are
displayed to modelers.

=head2 ExternalModelDefinition

@sbmlpackage{comp}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-comp.html Implementation of the ExternalModelDefinition construct
from the &ldquo;comp&rdquo; package.
The ExternalModelDefinition class was introduced by the SBML Level&nbsp;3
@ref comp @if java "Hierarchical Model Composition"@endif@~ 
package (&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) to define references to Model
objects defined in other files.
ExternalModelDefinition objects are model definitions&mdash;in and of
themselves, they are definitions of models but not uses of those models.
The class provides a way to declare and identify them so that Model
objects in the present SBML document can use them in Submodel objects.
ExternalModelDefinition contains two required attributes
("source" and "id") and three optional attributes
("modelRef", "md5" and "name").
The "id" attribute serves to provide a handle for the external
model reference so that Submodel objects can refer to it.  Crucially,
it is not the identifier of the model being referenced; rather,
it is an identifier for this ExternalModelDefinition object within the
current SBML document.  The "id" attribute takes a required value
of type SId, and must be unique across all Model and ExternalModelDefinition
objects present in the document.
ExternalModelDefinition also has an optional "name" attribute, of
type 'string'.  The "name" attribute may be used to provide
a human-readable description of the ExternalModelDefintion object.
The required attribute "source" is used to locate the SBML document
containing an external model definition.  The value of this attribute must
be of type anyURI.  Since URIs may be either URLs, URNs, or relative or
absolute file locations, this offers flexibility in referencing SBML
documents.  In all cases, the "source" attribute value must refer
specifically to an SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 document; prior
Levels/Versions of SBML are not supported by this package.  The entire
file at the given location is referenced.  The "source" attribute must
have a value for every ExternalModelDefinition instance.
ExternalModelDefinition's optional attribute "modelRef", of type
SIdRef, is used to identify a Model or
ExternalModelDefinition object within the SBML document located at
"source".  The object referenced may be the main model in the
document, or it may be a model definition contained in the SBML
document's ListOfModelDefinitions or
ListOfExternalModelDefinitions lists.  Loops are not allowed: it
must be possible to follow a chain of ExternalModelDefinition objects
to its end in a Model object.
In core SBML, the "id" on Model is an optional attribute, and therefore,
it is possible that the Model object in a given SBML document does not
have an identifier.  In that case, there is no value to give to the
"modelRef" attribute in ExternalModelDefinition.  If "modelRef" does not
have a value, then the main model (i.e., the C<&lt;model&gt;>
element within the C<&lt;sbml&gt;> element) in the referenced
file is interpreted as being the model referenced by this
ExternalModelDefinition instance.
Finally, the optional "md5" attribute takes a string value.  If
set, it must be an MD5 checksum value computed over the document
referenced by "source".  This checksum can serve as a data
integrity check over the contents of the "source".  Applications
may use this to verify that the contents have not changed since the time
that the ExternalModelDefinition reference was constructed.

=head2 Port

@sbmlpackage{comp}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-comp.html Implementation of the Port construct from the
&ldquo;comp&rdquo; package.
The Port class was introduced by the SBML Level&nbsp;3 @ref comp
@if java "Hierarchical Model Composition"@endif@~ package
(&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) to allow a Model to define a standard interface
between it and other models that might use it as a submodel.  It derives
from the SBaseRef class, and the elements defined there refer to elements
in the same parent Model as the Port object.  A Port object instance
therefore uses those attributes to define a port for a component in a
model.  When other SBaseRef or SBaseRef-derived classes refer to a Port
object using a "portRef" attribute, the element being referenced is the
element the Port object itself points to.
In the present formulation of the Hierarchical Model Composition
package, the use of ports is not enforced, nor is there any
mechanism to restrict which ports may be used in what ways&mdash;they are
only an advisory construct.  Future versions of this SBML package may
provide additional functionality to support explicit restrictions on
port use.  For the present definition of Hierarchical Model Composition,
users of models containing ports are encouraged to respect the modeler's
intention in defining ports, and use the port definitions to interact
with components through their ports (when they have ports defined)
rather than interact directly with the components.
The required attribute "id" is used to give an identifier to a
Port object so that other objects can refer to it.  The attribute has
type PortSId and is essentially identical to the SBML
primitive type SId, except that its namespace is limited to
the identifiers of Port objects defined within a Model object.  In
parallel, the PortSId type has a companion type,
PortSIdRef, that corresponds to the SBML primitive type
SIdRef; the value space of PortSIdRef is limited
to PortSId values.

interpretation of 'nested' replacements and deletions.
The 'removed' argument is present to ensure that the replaced element was
not already removed, which would make it impossible to check it for its
old IDs.  In normal comp flattening, 'removed' will only contain comp elements,
which should usually not be replaced, only deleted.


=back

=head2 ReplacedElement

@sbmlpackage{comp}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-comp.html Implementation of the ReplacedElement construct from the
&ldquo;comp&rdquo; package.
The ReplacedElement class was introduced by the SBML Level&nbsp;3
@ref comp @if java "Hierarchical Model Composition"@endif@~  package
(&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) to allow submodel elements to be replaced, but still
allow references to those elements to be valid.  A ReplacedElement object
is essentially a pointer to a submodel object that should be considered
'replaced'.  The object holding the ReplacedElement instance is the one
doing the replacing; the object pointed to by the ReplacedElement object
is the object being replaced.
A replacement implies that dependencies involving the replaced object
must be updated: all references to the replaced object elsewhere in the
model are taken to refer to the replacement object instead.  For
example, if one species replaces another, then any reference to the
original species in mathematical formulas, or lists of reactants or
products or modifiers in reactions, or initial assignments, or any other
SBML construct, are taken to refer to the replacement species, with its
value possibly modified by either this object's "conversionFactor"
attribute or the relevant submodel's conversion factors. Moreover, any 
annotations that refer to the
replaced species' "metaid" value must be made to refer to the
replacement species' "metaid" value instead; and anything else
that referred either to an object identifier (i.e., attributes such as
the "id" attribute whose types inherit from the SId
primitive data type) or the meta identifier (i.e., the "metaid"
attribute or any other attribute that inherits from the ID primitive
data type) must be made to refer to the replacement species object
instead.

It is worth noting that local parameters (inside Reaction objects) pose an
interesting edge case for these rules. In order to determine which element
is pointed to by a C<&lt;cn&gt;> element within the
C<&lt;math&gt;> element of a KineticLaw object, it is necessary
to examine the local parameters of that kinetic law's parent Reaction
object.  Whether the C<&lt;cn&gt;> element is considered to
point to something new, then, depends on whether it pointed to the local
parameter and whether that local parameter was replaced, even if the text
of the element matched the SId value of another element in the model.
Note that local parameters may only effectively be replaced by global
parameters, since references to its SId are only valid from within the
Reaction element to which it belongs.
When referencing an element within the Submodel pointed to by the 
"submodelRef" attribute (defined in libSBML in the Replacing class), 
any of the four attributes inherited from 
SBaseRef for the purpose may be used (portRef, idRef, unitRef, or 
metaIdRef), or a new optional attribute "deletion" may be used.  This
attribute must be the identifier of a Deletion
object in the parent Model of the ReplacedElement (i.e., the value of
some Deletion object's "id" attribute).  When "deletion" is
set, it means the ReplacedElement object is actually an annotation to
indicate that the replacement object replaces something deleted
from a submodel.  The use of the "deletion" attribute overrides
the use of the attributes inherited from SBaseRef: instead of using,
e.g., "portRef" or "idRef", the ReplacedElement instance
sets "deletion" to the identifier of the Deletion object.  In
addition, the referenced Deletion must be a child of the Submodel
referenced by the "submodelRef" attribute.
The use of ReplacedElement objects to refer to deletions has no effect
on the composition of models or the mathematical properties of the
result.  It serves instead to help record the decision-making process
that lead to a given model.  It can be particularly useful for
visualization purposes, as well as to serve as scaffolding where other
types of annotations can be added using the normal Annotation
subcomponents available on all SBase objects in SBML.
As with the Submodel class, it may be that the units of the replaced
element may not match the units of the replacement element.  In this case, 
the optional "conversionFactor" attribute may be used.  This attribute, if
present, defines how to transform or rescale the replaced object's value
so that it is appropriate for the new contexts in which the object
appears.  This attribute takes a value of type SIdRef, and
the value must refer to a Parameter object instance defined in the
model.  This parameter then acts as a conversion factor.
The value of the conversion factor should be defined such that a single
unit of the replaced element multiplied by the conversion factor should
equal a single unit of the replacement element, and the units of the
conversion factor should be commensurate with that transformation.  The
referenced Parameter may be non-constant, particularly if a Species is
replaced by a Species with a different "hasOnlySubstanceUnits"
attribute value, thus changing amount to concentration, or visa versa.

=item ReplacedElement::performReplacementAndCollect

Updates all IDs and references to those IDs, as well as performing all
necessary conversions based on the conversion factors.  Does not actually
remove the now-redundant element!  The elements to be removed is instead 
added to 'toremove', allowing one to remove the element carefully
to prevent double-deletion of elements, and to allow the correct
interpretation of 'nested' replacements and deletions.
The 'removed' argument is present to ensure that the replaced element was
not already removed, which would make it impossible to check it for its
old IDs.  In normal comp flattening, 'removed' will only contain comp elements,
which should usually not be replaced, only deleted.

=head2 Submodel

@sbmlpackage{comp}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-comp.html Implementation of the Submodel construct from the
&ldquo;comp&rdquo; package.
The Submodel class was introduced by the SBML Level&nbsp;3 @ref comp
@if java "Hierarchical Model Composition"@endif@~ package
(&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) as the principle way by which models are structured
hierarchically.  Submodels are instantiations of models contained within
other models.  They reference another Model that is to be instantiated
within its parent Model, and additionally define how that Model is to be
modified before instantiation.
The Submodel object class has a required attribute "modelRef", which must
reference another Model or ExternalModelDefinition object present in the
SBML Document.  This referenced Model is the model to be instantiated.
It also has a required attribute, "id", to give the submodel a unique
identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can refer to
it, and an optional "name" attribute of type C<string>.  Identifiers and
names must be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML
specification.

The Submodel class also provides constructs that define how the referenced
Model object is to be modified before it is instantiated in the enclosing
model.  If numerical values in the referenced model must be changed in order 
to fit them into their new context as part of the submodel, the changes can 
be handled through conversion factors.  If one or more structural features 
in the referenced model are undesirable and should be removed, the changes 
can be handled through deletions.  (For example, an initial assignment or 
reaction may not be relevant in its new context and should be removed.)
In some cases, the referenced Model may have been written with different
units than the containing model.  For most model elements, this is not a
problem: it is already possible to have Species and Parameter objects with
different units in a single model, for example, so in this case the
resulting hierarchical model would be treated in exactly the same way as
any other model with Species and Parameters with different units.
However, two units in SBML models are fixed and must not vary between SBML
elements: time and extent.  The units of time are set once per model, and
affect the core elements of RateRule, KineticLaw, Delay, and the
csymbols 'time' and 'delay'.  Even if the model does not explicitly state
what the units of time actually are, they are defined to be consistent
across the model, and therefore might differ from the units of time across
a parent model.  To correct this imbalance, the optional attribute
"timeConversionFactor" may be used, which, if defined, must reference a
constant parameter in the parent model. The value of the time conversion
factor should be defined such that a single unit of time in the Submodel
multiplied by the time conversion factor should equal a single unit of
time in the parent model.
Extent is the unit in SBML that defines how the KineticLaw of a Reaction
affects species quantities: kinetic laws are defined to be in units of
extent/time.  No other SBML core construct is defined in terms of extent.
If the effective units of extent in a submodel differ from the effective
units of extent in the parent model (regardless of whether either defined
what those units actually are), the optional attribute
"extentConversionFactor" may be used, which, if defined, must reference a
constant parameter in the parent model. The value of the extent conversion
factor should be defined such that a single unit of extent in the Submodel
multiplied by the extent conversion factor should equal a single unit of
extent in the parent model.
If features of the referenced model must be removed, a Deletion should be added 
to the Submodel object.  A Submodel may contain a child ListOfDeletions, which
in turn may contain one or more Deletion items.  Each Deletion references a single
element of the referenced Model that must be removed before instantiating that
Model as a submodel of the parent Model.

=head2 GraphicalObject

@sbmlpackage{layout}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-layout.html The basic &ldquo;layout&rdquo; package element for
storing layout information.
All the more specific layout elements (CompartmentGlyph, GeneralGlyph,
SpeciesGlyph, ReactionGlyph, ReferenceGlyph, TextGlyph, and
SpeciesReferenceGlyph) are derived from the class GraphicalObject. Each
object of class GraphicalObject has a mandatory BoundingBox, which
specifies the position and the size of the object.  While GraphicalObject
is the base class for most elements in the &ldquo;layout&rdquo; package,
it is not an abstract class. It can be instantiated when used in the
listOfAdditionalGraphicalObjects to describe additional elements and
relationships. Since it only describes a BoundingBox, programs are
encouraged to add Annotation objects that describe program-specific
graphical information.

=head2 ReactionGlyph

@sbmlpackage{layout}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-layout.html The ReactionGlyph is used to represent Reaction
elements in the layout.
Analogous to how a Reaction object has to at least have one reactant or
product, the ReactionGlyph has to at least have one SpeciesReferenceGlyph
stored in the ListOfSpeciesReferenceGlyphs. Figure 12 on the following
page provides the UML diagram for the class definition.  The ReactionGlyph
inherits from GraphicalObject. In addition to the attributes inherited
from GraphicalObject, the ReactionGlyph is described by an attribute
reaction, a Curve element and a listOfSpeciesReferenceGlyphs element.  The
Curve describes the center section of a ReactionGlyph. The center section
is frequently used by tools to separate the point where substrates arcs
come together, from the point where product arcs split off. The Curve is
optional, and when not present the dimensions of the inherited BoundingBox
describes the center section, by storing its position and dimension.

Each Output refers to a QualitativeSpecies that participates in (is affected by) the corresponding Transition. In Petri net models these are the output places of the transition. 
In a logical model, a QualitativeSpecies should be referenced in at most one ListOfOutputs, (that of the Transition defining the evolution of this species). When a Transition has several outputs, it is because the referenced species share the same regulators and the same logical rules.

=head2 QualitativeSpecies

@sbmlpackage{qual}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-qual.html The QualitativeSpecies class for the Qualitative Models
package.

Similarly to the Species in SBML, the components of qualitative models refer to pools of entities that are considered indistinguishable and are each located in a specific Compartment. However, here components are characterised by their qualitative influences rather than by taking part in reactions. Therefore, we define the QualitativeSpecies element to represent such pools of entities. 
In a Petri net, qualitative species refer to the places of the model, while in a logical model, they refer to the variables of this model (i.e. nodes of the influence graph).
A QualitativeSpecies describes a pool of indistinguishable entities in a Compartment. It is associated with a level (an integer representing e.g. an activity state, or a functional level of concentration, etc.)

=head2 Transition

@sbmlpackage{qual}

@htmlinclude pkg-marker-qual.html The Transition class for the Qualitative Models package.
A Transition element contains at most one ListOfInputs and one
ListOfOutputs and exactly one ListOfFunctionTerms.
A Transition defines the changes in level associated with the
QualitativeSpecies that occur when a Transition is enabled.
In logical models, a Transition is used to specify the logical rule
associated with a QualitativeSpecies (that appears as an Output of this
Transition). For example, the rule "if A E<gt> 1 : B = 2" would be
encapsulated as a Transition with QualitativeSpecies "A" as an Input and
"B" as an Output; the "if A E<gt> 1" rule being encode by the math element of
a FunctionTerm with the resultLevel attribute having a value "2".
In Petri net models, a Transition is interpreted, using the common Petri
net semantics, as events that might occur within the system causing tokens
to be moved.
