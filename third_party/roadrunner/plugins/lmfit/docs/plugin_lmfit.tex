\emph{Do some fitting}
\section{Introduction}
The Levenberg-Marquardt plugin is used to fit a proposed SBML models parameters to experimental data. 

The current implementation is based on the lmfit C library by Joachim Wuttke. See footnote\footnote{The package lmfit is distributed under the FreeBSD License:

The current plugin has one capability, named \verb|LMFit|. The plugin has numerous parameters, as documented below.

\section{Plugin Parameters}
In the following, plugin parameters available in the Levenberg-Marquardt plugin are discussed.

\hline % inserts single horizontal line
PluginStarted  	& 	void*, & Signal to application that the plugin has started. \\
PluginProgress	& 	int*  & Signal progress of fitting, in \% (0-100\%). \\

\end{table}

\section{The \texttt{execute()} function}
The lmfit plugins \verb|execute()| function supports two arguments;

\verb|execute(void* rrData, bool workInThread)|

where \verb|rrData| is a handle to RoadRunner data and \verb|workInThread| is a boolean denoting if the work is to be executed in a thread or not.
